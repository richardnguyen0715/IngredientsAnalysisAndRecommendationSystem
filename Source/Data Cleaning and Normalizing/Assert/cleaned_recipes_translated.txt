Title: Carrot Bread
Ingredients:
Every time I make bread, I still can't help but feel excited and nervous when the bread comes out of the oven. I really like the smell of hot bread coming out of the oven, and the whole kitchen smells of bread, that smell on those hot days. Winter makes the house feel warmer. When baking cakes, the whole house smells very sweet, but it doesn't feel as cozy as the smell of bread.
Even though I bake bread very often, I still love kneading dough, the soft feel of the dough in my hands, and after it has risen, I love pulling the dough apart to see the network of connections between the flour. That is the first step to a successful batch of bread.
Why is that just the first step, because the next step is baking, if the temperature and time are not reasonable, it can also lead to a batch of bread being ruined. For example, with this batch of bread, I set the time in advance, then went to pick up my child, planning to go home just in time. But when I got home, although the time was not up yet, the surface of the bread was already a bit darker than I expected. The surface, sides and bottom of the bread were all overcooked. Therefore, during the baking process, it is best to be present so that you can take ‚Äúimmediate action‚Äù when observing the situation of the bread in the oven.
Also because this time I set the temperature higher and didn't take it out in time when the surface of the cake had just turned a nice color, my batch of cakes turned out drier. Even when the cake was still hot and fresh from the oven, it was still very soft, easy to tear into thin slices and the inside was very soft, but when I ate the cold cake, I could clearly see that the cake was drier, even though before baking, the moisture of the cake was very okie.
At the same time, I once again compared bread made in the usual way and bread made with tangzhong (cooked flour), and I confirmed that bread made with tangzhong is always softer and more moist.
Anyway, with this batch of bread, my family finished it quickly when eating it with braised chicken and soup. The kids ate it enthusiastically, and I was still happier when they ate carrot bread instead of white bread, although my kids are not lazy to eat vegetables but they are still happy üòõ
To make carrot bread, if you have a carrot juicer, use the juicer to extract the juice. If you don't have a juicer like me, use a small grater to grate the carrots, then squeeze out the juice. Use the carrot pulp to mix with the flour. Carrots are a type of root vegetable with a lot of water, so when you grate them into small pieces, you can squeeze out enough carrot juice to use. To make the surface of the cake look nice, you can sprinkle oats, poppy seeds or sesame seeds. After baking, break the cake open and you have to look closely to see the carrot fibers ????

Title: Fried onion cake
Ingredients:
Before making this cake, I only intended to make a slightly different cake to ‚Äúchange the atmosphere‚Äù. Occasionally, I also let my family eat fried foods, but I don‚Äôt absolutely ‚Äúavoid‚Äù them. If I talk about fried foods that I often make, I have to mention donuts, a type of cake that almost no child dislikes.
The first day, I mixed a bowl of this dough, after frying it, the whole family tried it and everyone liked it, the whole batch was gone. The next day, my second child had a ‚Äúshare lunch‚Äù at school, each child would contribute a dish, so I tried making this dish for my child to bring to school to see how it was. At the end of the session, she brought home an empty box, saying that the whole class ate it all, everyone liked it. Each ‚Äúshare lunch‚Äù session usually has a lot of dishes and everyone prepares a lot because they plan to share enough for the whole class, there is often leftover food, but my child‚Äôs dish was eaten completely, so I was happy. The very next day, my older child also had a share lunch in class, I made a third batch of cakes, and the result was that at the end of the session she also brought home an empty box, giving feedback that everyone in class liked it.
Wow, three consecutive batches of cakes were processed very quickly in three days. So I can rest assured that I have another "favorite" dish for large gatherings ???? Why did I choose this dish? Because of three reasons: simple ingredients, quick to prepare, easy to eat.
The secret to making this cake really delicious: lots of onions + lots of sesame. I tried it, at first I thought that lots of green onions would be something kids and ‚ÄúWesterners‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt like, but in fact I added a lot of onions and didn‚Äôt get any complaints hihi ????

Title: Pizza rolls
Ingredients:
Normally I don't make pizza much, every time I make this dish it takes a lot of time, kneading the dough to make the base, then making the tomato sauce, and preparing all the topping ingredients such as vegetables, meat and cheese.
Today I tried to overcome my ‚Äúshyness‚Äù and made this pizza roll for my kids. In general, the extra rolling step significantly increased the time to complete this dish. But in return, after the pizza was out of the oven, the children‚Äôs joy and cheers made me feel that it was worth it. Every now and then, a little decoration brings simple joy to the kids and vice versa, the adults can also share that joy.
Today I made pizza with pepperoni salami and tri-colored bell peppers as toppings. It‚Äôs tomato season now, so tomatoes are cheap and ripe, perfect for making your own tomato sauce. For the pizza dough, I used a deep-dish pizza dough recipe. This deep-dish pizza recipe can make two flat sheets of dough to roll out.

Title: Oreo cheesecake
Ingredients:
‚Öî recipe - homemade oreo
1 recipe - oreo cheesecake
1 pack of store bought Oreo cookies
250 ml whipping cream

Title: Lemon brownies
Ingredients:
Today's lemon brownies have a lemon glaze on top, made very simply by mixing lemon juice with powdered sugar until it becomes a thick enough mixture to pour over the surface of the cake. This glaze layer combined with the cake underneath is very interesting because it highlights the lemon flavor right from the moment you put the cake in your mouth, giving a mild sour and cool feeling. When cutting through the glaze layer, there is a slightly crispy feeling that is very interesting.
To add a little more interest to the cake, I also chopped up some pumpkin seeds to sprinkle on top. The pumpkin seeds add a green color to the cake to make it less monotonous. To make the pumpkin seeds stick to the cake without falling off, after pouring the lemon glaze, sprinkle the pumpkin seeds before the glaze dries, so the pumpkin seeds won't fall off.
I baked this batch of cookies for 30 minutes. But I found that if I baked them for only 25 minutes, the cookies would be more moist, more like brownies. Therefore, in the recipe below, I set the baking time to 25 minutes. If your cookies are more moist than the ones in my picture, rest assured that they are still perfect.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Coffee cheesecake
Ingredients:
This cheesecake combines all the flavors and styles that my whole family loves. The cake is soft, smooth, and creamy, with a distinct coffee flavor, and the base is rich in chocolate. Although the cake looks quite simple, with only two components: the base and the cheesecake, it took me quite a while to make it.
First, I mixed the dough for the cake base. Actually, when making cheesecake, people often use pre-bought biscuits, put them in a blender or crush them, mix them with butter and then flatten them to make the cake base. However, I rarely use pre-bought biscuits and usually make them myself. This time, I chose Oreos as the cake base, following the recipe I used to make homemade Oreos here:
But I didn‚Äôt bake the Oreos separately and then blend them, but after mixing the dough, I used that dough to press into the base and the sides of the cake. If you only make the base without making the cake, that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs even simpler, and it won‚Äôt take as much time as I did. Because I wanted to make the sides of the cake, and I used ‚Äúfresh‚Äù dough, after baking for a while, the dough on the sides of the cake started to flow down, just like your normal cake will expand and flatten on the baking tray, especially since the Oreo dough has a lot of butter. Therefore, I had to watch the oven, when I saw the dough on the sides of the cake start to expand and flow down, I had to take it out, then use the back of a spoon to flatten the dough back to the way it was at first. The base of the cake will also expand, of course, just like when making cookies, and I also need to use a spoon to press down. Then put it back in the oven for a few more minutes.
Although it took a bit of effort to make the crust and the sides of the cake, I was very pleased with the result. After baking, the crust and cake were chewy and moist like the feeling when eating brownies, combined with the soft cheesecake, it was even more wonderful. If you make the crust from cookies, the crust will be harder and a bit crunchy, not having the soft feeling of brownies. However, whichever way you choose to make it is up to you, depending on the time you have.
I made an Oreo recipe which is enough to make both the base and sides for a 20cm cheesecake like this. If you are just making the base without the sides, half the recipe will be enough.
I have an espresso machine at home, so instead of using instant black coffee powder, I made two shots of strong espresso, so my cake has a very strong coffee flavor. If you don't have an espresso machine, you can use instant black coffee powder, choose a good type of coffee, mix with hot water to make 80ml of strong coffee.
The flowers in my garden are blooming, so lately when I make cakes, all the flowers are put on the cake ???? It's hard to imagine life without flowers, without cakes, without tea and coffee, hihi ????

Title: Yoghurt poppy seeds cake
Ingredients:
Two other differences in this cake are that I used cooking oil instead of butter, which makes the cake soft even when eaten cold. (Usually, cakes that use butter as a fat will become hard when cold.) , when eating, you need to leave the cake outside for a while to soften it so it's more enjoyable to eat.) Next, I sprinkled a little oatmeal on top of the cake, the cake is more nutritious, looks more attractive and when eating the surface of the cake has a crunchy feel, very enjoyable.

Title: Crumble lemon cheesecake bars
Ingredients:
Another year is almost over, but I still don‚Äôt feel any peace, I just feel like I‚Äôm working hard all week, and on the weekends I‚Äôm still in the kitchen preparing meals for the family that are a little more ‚Äúproper‚Äù than during the week, and when I‚Äôm not too tired I‚Äôll bake. But every time I make a delicious cake that makes my husband and children exclaim, sometimes even saying that it‚Äôs so delicious that I have to eat sparingly or it will be gone quickly, I feel very happy.
NZ is in the lavender season. The photo above is my family taking advantage of the "early season" ????, the flowers have not yet bloomed, now that it is the season, I have not arranged to go again. This flower really fascinates me. I like flowers with small, pretty flowers more than those with big flowers. That day, my family freely picked a lot of fresh lavender. Now we are drying them to get dried flowers to make the house smell good.
Flowers come in every season so they will always appear on my cakes.
I don't need to say much about delicious cheesecake, anyone who loves cake knows it all. I'll just say a little about the difference of this cake. That is, the cake base and the crispy topping on the cake are made from 100% whole wheat flour, without mixing in white flour. In addition, there are also oats, so the cake is even more nutritious. Finally, the "secret" that makes the cake leave a wonderful aftertaste, the scent of lemon is so "full", so satisfying, that is I grated the lemon peel and mixed it into the cake base and crust. (Hehe, the secret is not that terrible, but enough to create a deep impression ????)
Many people often do not pre-bake the crust, but I do not like the crust to be moist or soft, so I bake the crust separately until it is about 60% cooked, then I add the filling and bake it again. The result is that both the crust and the topping are crispy and very fragrant.

Title: Molasses oatmeal cookies
Ingredients:
When you bake a lot, you will also know this ingredient. Molasses is often used in the famous molasses-flavored cookies, which I have also made. Personally, my husband and I really like the taste of molasses, but the kids don't like it very much. Although the cookies have oats, raisins and I added shredded coconut - which they all like - they still eat it with little enthusiasm, even though they initially mistook it for chocolate cookies ????
I say this so that you can see that children still have many things that adults think are delicious but they don't like, not that molasses are difficult to eat and not delicious. On the contrary, these cookies are very nutritious. The ingredients of the cake are used a lot of oats, plus fragrant shredded coconut, plus chewy raisins, the aroma of molasses is very prominent, making the cake very attractive. I myself also really like the roughness of these cookies.
These days of late winter and early spring, do you know what is abundant in NZ? It is magnolia. Since living in NZ, I have been able to see the beauty of magnolia with my own eyes. In this country, there are white, bright pink and dark pink flowers, I find every color of flower fascinating, it is true that each flower has its own charm.
The tall magnolia trees were in full bloom, even though winter was still more than half a month away. Some trees had pure white flowers, while others had ivory-white flowers, like a painting.
Magnolias are grown in parks and family gardens. Every house in NZ has a spacious garden, so every house grows many types of flowers and fruit trees, from big to small, from main trees to secondary trees, very diverse and all year round you can enjoy different types of flowers and fruits according to the season. The "old" magnolia trees, meaning extremely tall trees, I don't know how many years they have to be planted to grow that big, but when the whole tree is in full bloom, they look extremely majestic, with an incredibly gorgeous beauty.
White fence, magnolia tree covered in bright pink and red, standing out against the blue sky with a few white clouds, what do you think? There are images that I used to only see on pictures on the internet, but now I can see them with my own eyes, I feel so lucky.
As usual, on weekends, if it doesn‚Äôt rain, my husband and I will take a walk around where we live, looking at the sky, the land, the trees and discovering what has changed, which trees are blooming, which trees are budding, and in the fall, which trees are changing color, which trees have lost all their leaves. These are the most relaxing and wonderful times.
Then after walking back, I went back to the kitchen to make cookies, and the whole ‚Äúlittle hut‚Äù was filled with the scent of cookies. These cookies are crispy, very fragrant, and great to eat with tea ????

Title: Lemon layer cake
Ingredients:
Butter cake has the characteristic of feeling hard when cold, unlike cake made with cooking oil, but actually when you cut into the cake, you will still feel the softness and moisture of the cake (unless you bake the cake too long, the cake will dry out and become hard and tough). Although this cake does not have the smoothness of the cake dough, I baked the cake just right, the cake is soft and moist, mixed with smooth cream cheese for a melting feeling in the mouth, extremely delicious (must praise again ????)

Title: Parsley and cheese scones
Ingredients:
Savory scones are also very diverse. Since living in NZ, I have also been interested in making scones again and making many different types for my family to eat. I make more savoury scones than sweet ones. Scones are quick to make, not difficult, easy and convenient, saving time for breakfast. Every time I make scones, I also make quite a lot to save for later. In the morning, I just need to put the scones in the microwave to warm them up and both adults and children can have a delicious breakfast.
Today I am sharing a parsley and cheese scone. This is my family's favorite scone. My family loves cheese so they really like the scone filled with cheese inside and the top of the scone is also covered with cheese. Parsley is just a spice, but my family really likes it. This herb is fragrant but has a light, pleasant flavor so I always use a lot without worrying about the scone being "overwhelming". Many people only use one or two spoons of chopped herbs, but I always make a whole handful. I guarantee the scone is delicious and that amount of herbs is not much at all ????
Scones are easy to make, but for some people they are still considered difficult to make. The difficulty is how to make the cake not tough, not too hard and dense, but need to be spongy, the inside of the cake is soft, moist, and the cake is not dry.
I have read and made scones many times, but there are mainly just a few notes:
Once you understand the principles, making scones is very easy and you will have soft, moist cakes, breaking the cake will reveal the softness and fluffiness inside. With scones, you usually need to use cold butter, cut into small cubes, then use your hands or a mixer to mix the butter and flour together into a dry mixture like breadcrumbs. However, I have made it many times and found that it is not always necessary to do so, such as today's cheese scones. I usually cut the butter into very small cubes and put it in the mixer to mix with the flour for a while.
Every time I make scones, I usually make a lot, then put them in the fridge, every morning I will take them out and heat them for about 30 seconds to keep them hot, let the kids eat them for breakfast in rotation with other dishes. Next time I will introduce other delicious scones to everyone ????

Title: Super soft and moist chocolate cake
Ingredients:
If you don‚Äôt like coffee, you can replace it with hot water. When making this cake, I also chose good quality cocoa powder to get the best flavor. Overall, the result is that this cake is loved by the whole family.
According to the recipe I share below, it is enough to make 3 20cm round molds. But I only have 2 round molds, so I poured the remaining cake batter into cupcake molds and made 12 more cupcakes. The house is crowded and both children and adults eat cakes very enthusiastically, so making a lot is never afraid of having leftovers. If you want to make less, you can adjust the recipe to reduce it.

Title: Cinnamon Roll Bread
Ingredients:
These are the two loaves that I made this time. When it‚Äôs cold, there‚Äôs nothing like enjoying a warm, fragrant cinnamon bread. The bread is delicious and cinnamon is very good for your health, especially on cold days. The aroma of cinnamon bread is hard to describe.
It is a sweet bread, with the bread dough including butter, sugar, milk, eggs, so the bread is very soft, moist and fragrant, the sweetness of the bread is moderate, combined with the sugar filling mixed with cinnamon powder is very perfect. There are two types of white sugar, one is caster sugar (or castor) - also known as superfine in English, the type of small, fine grains, but not powdered at all, the other is a type of white sugar with larger grains, called granulated sugar. Normally when making cakes, we only need to use granulated sugar, this is the common type, with some cakes that need "special effects" then we need to use castor sugar.
The ‚Äúspecial effect‚Äù that made me choose castor sugar for this cake is that I don‚Äôt want the cake to be too sweet and when chewing, I don‚Äôt want to feel the ‚Äúgritty‚Äù and crunchy texture due to the large sugar grains, so I use castor sugar mixed with cinnamon powder. I can cover the cake filling with a layer of cinnamon sugar without the cake being too sweet, and when eating, the sugar grains don‚Äôt fall out as much as when using large sugar grains.
If you feel you are not familiar with many types of bread, please take the time to refer to other articles about bread. Once you are familiar, you will grasp the rules of making bread and almost every time you make it, you will be successful.

Title: How to make beef stew bread
Ingredients:
In the North, autumn and winter, when the weather is cold, are especially suitable times to eat beef stew. That is my feeling, as someone who comes from Hanoi and has lived here for more than twenty years. In the South, where the weather is hot all year round, people do not feel any different when slurping a bowl of beef stew in the cool weather, so even if it is 40 degrees outside, people can still enjoy delicious beef stew?
For beef stew, I like to use the beef with a lot of tendons the most. The beef tendon is stewed until soft, the tendons are still crispy and the meat is not mushy. The part of beef I like to use the most, also influenced by my mother, is the ribs, which are both tendons and tough, and not too meaty, making delicious beef stews or beef stew soups. I usually only like to use lean beef in stir-fried beef dishes.
This part of beef has a lot of fat because it is not completely lean. That is why this dish needs to be eaten while it is still hot, because if the dish cools down, the fat layer from the beef will form, making the dish no longer delicious.
There are many ways to cook beef stew, many ways to combine ingredients in a pot of beef stew. Today I introduce this beef stew, I only add tomatoes to add color, thickness, and add carrots and onions to add sweetness. You can add radishes and potatoes if you like.
Wow, a bowl of beef stew with bread is really great ^^ Enjoy your meal everyone!!!

Title: Walnut brownies with caramel sauce
Ingredients:
Today, Linh would like to introduce to you a very delicious brownie. If you make this cake to serve guests, it will be luxurious, delicious, and nutritious. Every time I make this cake, my kids and their dads always grab a portion very quickly.
For those of you who have been baking for a long time, you are probably familiar with the brownie genre. For those of you who are new to baking, I will briefly introduce this type of cake so that you have a basic concept. Brownie is a dense, soft, moist cake, often made with chocolate flavor, and the cake is cut into small square or rectangular pieces. When eaten, brownie is not soft and light like sponge cake, but you will feel very full, very thick, and very rich in flavor. There are many variations of brownie with different combinations of ingredients, very rich and all very delicious.
Those of you who have made and eaten brownies know how delicious they are. Brownies are also great for birthday cakes or special occasions, simply because they are so delicious and almost everyone loves them.
If we talk about chocolate brownies, the secret to making delicious brownies is first of all that you need to choose good baking chocolate or cocoa powder. There are brownie recipes that only use chocolate, recipes that only use cocoa powder, and recipes that combine both. I always have in my baking notebook a variety of recipes to suit the ingredients I have in my kitchen.
When making brownies, I usually choose good chocolate. Currently in Vietnam, if you go to shops selling baking ingredients, you will see two popular types of chocolate: compound chocolate and couverture chocolate. I recommend that you buy couverture chocolate to make brownies, which will be more "worthy" of the cake than using compound chocolate. I usually choose chocolate with 65% or more for a more delicious chocolate flavor and moderate sweetness.
The second secret is not to overbake when making brownies. The characteristic of brownies is softness and moisture, do not see the cake is still moist and think that the cake is not cooked yet and try to bake it more, when baking more the cake will dry out, losing the soft and moist nature of the brownie. When you first make it, you should choose the right type and size of pan recommended in the recipe, set the oven to the right temperature, and watch the right time to take the cake out of the oven before it is overbaked. Many bakers accept a slightly underbaked cake rather than overbaked, the cake is still delicious and do not be afraid that the cake will not be cooked.
Once you get used to it and make many different types of brownies, you will gain experience in how to test when the brownie is done, and from there you will be able to change the recipe according to different sizes of molds and trays, and change the temperature and baking time more proficiently.
The next secret is to make brownies with a normal thickness of about 2-2.5cm, do not make them too thin or the cake will burn and dry out easily, and do not make them too thick because it will take longer to bake, and baking them longer will make the cake dry. Brownies with added toppings, such as cream cheese or nuts, will be a little taller.
Today's brownie is special because it has a special structure, so it is much taller than regular brownie.

Title: Strawberry custard tart
Ingredients:
I make the cream first, let it cool and put it in the fridge. Then I turn to make the tart base. Once the tart base is baked, let it cool, then add the cream to about half or 2/3 of the depth of the tart base. Finally, arrange fresh fruit. You should choose fruit that is sweet and sour to balance the sweetness and fat of the tart and cream base. The most popular fruits are berries, such as strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, or grape, kiwi, mango, etc... This time my tart is mainly strawberry. I added some raisins and sliced almonds to make the tart more attractive. guide.
The answer is: you can absolutely make the tart crust in advance to use later.

Title: Learn about Tiramisu cake and Kokotaru's recipe
Ingredients:
Tiramisu is the most famous cake from Italy, this is something many of you probably already know. Tiramisu is characterized by the combination of ladyfingers (a long, spongy, crispy cookie, in Vietnam this cake is called sam-pa cake, champagne cake) dipped in a coffee liquor mixture, between the layers of cake is a layer of egg cream and soft mascarpone cheese. Making tiramisu is not difficult, it just requires a little bit of effort. But making a delicious tiramisu cake is really difficult. Why is that?
Linh brings up this issue because more and more people are making Tiramisu and selling it online for only 70-80K/big box (a rectangular food storage box) and advertising it as delicious. Linh can only smile sadly. How can ‚Äúreal‚Äù Tiramisu be so cheap, the cost of the ingredients is not enough, let alone‚Ä¶
Linh used to be very excited to try Tiramisu at decent cafes and restaurants, but sometimes just looking at the cake brought out was disappointing. Tiramisu cream is very soft, adding a layer of cake dipped in coffee makes it even softer, but many Tiramisu cakes "outside" stand tall and cannot be poured, easily cut into neat, clean pieces, which is great, the cream layer is even dry and chewy and can be peeled off into another layer.
The employees who have worked with Linh for many years, when eating the Tiramisu Linh makes, wonder how the cream layer is different from the cream they were taught at school. It turns out that at school and in many places online, the students learn that gelatin is added to the cream to make it harder, and of course, many places do not have any "cheese" in it, so even the word "mascarpone" is completely foreign to them.
I only discuss the issue of how to make a tiramisu cake that when eaten we feel oh how delicious it is. I rarely like to discuss the issue of what is ‚Äústandard‚Äù because I know that when it comes to food, there are always differences, variations, changes over time and according to locality.
In short, in my opinion, with high-end cakes, you should try to buy good quality ones or better within your ability to make the most delicious cakes for your loved ones to enjoy.
Since the first days of baking, Linh has kept the mindset of respecting cakes and recipes, especially "classic" cakes. Linh used to make classic Tiramisu according to the recipe from Joyofbaking and was always satisfied with that recipe, until now, there have only been small changes to better suit her taste.
The tradition is to use ladyfingers, also known as champagne cakes, to make Tiramisu. But Linh doesn't like to use this type of cake very much because this cake is quite sweet, and the layer of sugar covering the surface of the cake makes the cake even sweeter.
After many years, Linh switched to using only sponge cake. The sponge cake she made herself had just the right amount of sweetness, and when she needed to make a cake, she baked it so it was very fresh and delicious. It was clearly better than using industrially produced cakes.
Sometimes I use Hong Kong sponge cake when making round Tiramisu, sometimes I use roll cake when making square or rectangular cakes. Replacing ladyfingers with a sponge cake is not a new thing, many home-bakers and professional bakers have done so.
Because Tiramisu is very soft due to the sponge cake being soft, when soaked in wine and coffee it becomes even softer, and the cream itself is also super smooth, so Tiramisu is usually made in small cups, each person enjoys a portion like that.
Even if you make it in a large mold, it is very difficult to cut out a piece of cake that can stand up nicely, it will tilt, fall over and be soft, not looking as attractive as when presented in a small cup.
Tiramisu cake has many ingredients that spoil very quickly, such as cheese, eggs and milk, so this type of cake does not last long. The cake will be best when you enjoy it after a day in the refrigerator. That means you make the cake a day in advance, leave it in the refrigerator overnight, and the next day you enjoy it‚Ä¶ wow, it is really delicious.
The longest time to keep this cake in the refrigerator is only 3-4 days, and the cake should be kept in a sealed box, avoid leaving the cake exposed as it will lose its aroma and absorb the smell of other foods in the refrigerator.
You can also freeze tiramisu if for some reason you need to make it in advance, or make too much and can't eat it all at once. After freezing the tiramisu, when you need to use it, you must put it in the refrigerator several hours in advance to let it defrost slowly in the refrigerator. When freezing, it should not be frozen for more than 3 months.
With all the experience, I will share my own best classic Tiramisu recipe, which has been changed a bit compared to other recipes.
I remember the first tiramisu I made and took a picture of. At that time, the cake was not soaked with coffee, but the cake was very soft and I had a hard time cutting a small square piece. When taking the picture, I had to be very quick, worrying about the cake falling over. Later, I read more about tiramisu and made more, and I understood more about this type of cake.
Hope you make some delicious tiramisu for your family to enjoy!

Title: How to make German chocolate cheesecake
Ingredients:
But everything has its price? No matter how complicated the cake is, the result is that the whole family can enjoy a delicious cake. This is the kind of cake that once you eat it, you want to eat more, but you don't want to finish it all, and once you finish it, you have to wait until you feel like it to go back to the kitchen to make it again. Hehe.
This elaborate cake consists of many layers of cake, a combination of cheesecake and chocolate cake. Add coconut ‚Äúcream‚Äù and walnuts, so this cake is guaranteed to be very fatty and energetic. However, its delicious taste is also hard to resist.
Linh made this cake in a 20cm round mold. However, with its height and ‚Äúdensity‚Äù, each person only needs a piece of 1/12 of the cake, along with a cup of good tea, which is more than enough to enjoy in any situation and weather condition.
At the bottom is the Oreo base. You can make your own Oreos or buy them ready-made, just take the cake and leave out the cream. Next is the chocolate cheesecake layer, then the coconut walnut cream layer, then another layer of chocolate cheesecake, and finally the coconut cream layer on top.

Title: Brioche Bread Recipe
Ingredients:
‚Äì Add the softened butter little by little, kneading until the butter is mixed with the flour into a smooth mass. This mass of dough will be very soft and sticky.
‚Äì If baking individual brioche balls, leave the dough in the refrigerator overnight and shape into small balls the next day. Refrigerating will make the dough less sticky, making it easier to work with and look better.
‚Äì If you bake brioche in a large pan like you would a regular loaf of bread, you don‚Äôt need to leave it overnight. Just let the dough rest for about 20 minutes and then pour it into the pan.
‚Äì Once the dough has been put into the mold, optionally, you can brush egg yolk to make the crust shiny or just bake it right away.
‚Äì Baking temperature: 200o C for small brioche mold or 190o C for large mold.
‚Äì Baking time is not fixed, you need to monitor and observe the color of the crust. The cake surface is golden brown.
(Note: to make the dough less sticky, you can reduce the butter to only 3/4 or 1/2 of the original amount of butter, however the cake will not be as soft, fragrant and flavorful as when made with the full amount of butter)
Hehe, this cake is great for breakfast ^^

Title: Cookies with Sunflower Seeds
Ingredients:
After overcoming the ‚Äúshyness‚Äù then‚Ä¶ the cake is so delicious. And it makes sense, so many delicious ingredients are ‚Äúmolded‚Äù into such a cake. I have to admit that this is one of those cookies that after I finish one, I want to eat another right away üòõ
The cake is dry, looks hard but when you eat it, it feels very chewy. And it is chewy because there are raisins and dried apricots in the cake. In addition to the sweet and sour taste of the two dried fruits, there is the fragrant and rich taste of sunflower seeds and almonds. I really like sunflower seeds. When I was a kid, I only liked to chew sunflower seeds with my friends. We would huddle around a tiny bag of sunflower seeds bought at the school gate. In the classroom, almost every desk was full of sunflower shells, both girls and boys liked to "bite" them.
‚Äì Mix flour, baking powder, cinnamon powder, salt in a bowl.
‚Äì Use a mixer to beat butter and sugar at high speed until butter and sugar are smooth and creamy.
‚Äì Add eggs, beat until eggs are well mixed with butter.
‚Äì Add raisins, dried apricots, almonds and sunflower seeds, mix well with spatula.
‚Äì Add the flour mixture and mix into a soft dough. Shape the dough into a 35cm long cylinder. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
‚Äì Turn on the oven at 180o C. Line a baking tray with baking paper.
‚Äì Use a knife to cut the cylindrical dough into pieces about 1cm thick. Place these pieces of dough 1.5-2cm apart on the baking tray.
‚Äì Bake for 10-15 minutes until the cake is a nice golden brown color.
‚Äì Remove the cake and place on a rack to cool completely.

Title: Sweet chocolate cake for Valentine's Day
Ingredients:
The cake is especially delicious, the color is very typical of classic romance. Since last week, I closed my eyes and bought a box of fresh raspberries, every day I anxiously looked at the raspberries in the refrigerator but could not make this cake right away, they were wilted and looked very pitiful.
The cake has a slightly bitter taste of cocoa, mixed with the cool, sweet feeling of chocolate mousse. Biting into the cake with raspberries makes me even more ecstatic because of the special slightly sour feeling. Overall, I am very satisfied with the cake that I made very hastily in my tired mood and body, but the result was worth the effort.
(for 21-23cm diameter removable bottom pan. Recipe learned from joyofbaking.com, modified)
‚Äì Turn on the oven at 177 degrees Celsius.
‚Äì Line the bottom of the pan with baking paper and grease the sides of the pan with butter.
‚Äì Mix melted butter and vanilla in a small bowl, keep warm.
‚Äì Sift together cake flour and cocoa powder. Set aside.
‚Äì Put eggs and sugar in a small pot.
‚Äì Place a large pan or pot with boiling water on the stove, place the egg pot in the pan/pot of boiling water, stir continuously until the egg-sugar mixture is warm. Then immediately put this mixture into a bowl, use a mixer to beat at high speed until the mixture cools and is light and fluffy, the volume increases 2-3 times, until the beater is lifted up and the mixture flows down in ribbon-like strips.
‚Äì Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the egg mixture, use a large spatula to mix gently and evenly. Continue mixing in the remaining 1/2 of the flour, then mix in the last portion of flour. Do not mix too long, too thoroughly, or too vigorously, or the eggs will deflate.
‚Äì Take out 1 cup of the above mixture and mix it with the bowl of melted butter (still warm). Mix until the butter is well mixed with the flour, then add the entire bowl of butter to the egg flour mixture. Mix well and smooth.
‚Äì Pour the mixture into the mold, flatten the surface of the cake.
‚Äì Bake for 20-25 minutes. The cake is done when you press lightly with your finger and it will not dent but will return to its original flat state.
‚Äì Let the cake cool completely, then use a small knife to run along the edge of the mold, then remove the cake from the mold.
‚Äì Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Keep the melted chocolate warm.
‚Äì Use a whipping cream machine to beat until soft peaks form. Store in the refrigerator for later use.
‚Äì Put the egg yolks in a large bowl and set aside.
‚Äì Mix sugar and water in a small pot, bring to a boil on the stove until the sugar dissolves. Then slowly pour the sugar syrup into the egg bowl, stirring the eggs as you pour.
‚Äì Place the bowl of eggs in the pot/pan of boiling water, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens and lightens in color (the mixture will become hot).
‚Äì Quickly pour eggs into the bowl of a mixer, beat at medium speed until doubled in volume or until mixture cools.
‚Äì At low speed, beat melted chocolate into eggs until well blended.
‚Äì Take 1/2 whipped whipping cream and mix it into the mixture until smooth. Then mix in the remaining 1/2 whipping cream.
‚Äì If the mixture is a bit runny after mixing, put it in the refrigerator until it is hard enough (several hours or overnight).
‚Äì Cut the genoise chocolate into 2 slices.
‚Äì Mix orange juice with Grand Marnier. Then use a brush to spread the mixture evenly over the 2 slices of cake until finished.
‚Äì Spread chocolate mousse evenly over the surface of one layer of cake, then place the other slice of cake on top.
‚Äì Sprinkle with powdered sugar and arrange with raspberries to decorate.
This is this year's Valentine's cake, the first cake I've made myself for a multi-event Valentine's Day.
My Valentine's gift this year is the latest edition of Professional Baking book. My love is so wonderful. This book is exactly what I've been wishing for for a long time (since I knew there was such a book ^^). I don't have to read the old library book anymore.
Happy sweet and happy Valentine's Day to everyone.

Title: Lemon and Dried Cranberry Butter Cake
Ingredients:
So the first time I read this recipe, I couldn't help but stick out my tongue because the amount of ingredients was so huge, especially the amount of sugar and eggs was a bit terrifying, so I kept putting it off. Until I had enough courage to make this cake, and when I ate it, I nodded "it would be a waste not to do it". The cake was delicious until the last bite, after eating one bite, I immediately craved another.
Of course, to get enough inspiration to make it, I also had to change the ingredients a bit compared to the recipe (refer to joyofbaking.com). The sugar was reduced, lemon juice and lemon zest were used more, cranberries were also added to increase the sourness and reduce the sweetness. The result was a cake that turned out exactly as expected and was very suitable for everyone in the house. The cake is delicious when eaten warm or cold. My family kept it in the refrigerator for a few days, the more they ate, the more delicious it became.
This cake can be baked in a bundt pan, or more classically, in a regular round pan. Sometimes, after baking the round cake, you can slice it, layer it with lemon curd in between, and then cover it with buttercream to decorate it, making the cake even more ‚Äúrich‚Äù üòõ
My family doesn't have a decent bundt cake mold so the cake comes out in a unique shape like this.
(for bundt mold diameter 25cm)
‚Äì Put lemon juice, brandy, dried cranberries in a small pot, bring to a boil then turn off the heat.

‚Äì Continue using the mixer at low speed, add 1/3 of the flour mixture, beat until the flour is well blended.
‚Äì Next add 1/2 sour cream/yogurt, beat until the mixture is smooth.
‚Äì Continue with 1/3 flour, then 1/2 sour cream/yogurt alternately, and finally the remaining 1/3 flour.
‚Äì Once the flour mixture is smooth, add the cranberries and mix well.
‚Äì Pour the mixture into the mold.
‚Äì Place the mold in the center of the oven, bake for 80-85 minutes, test by skewering a toothpick and if it comes out clean or has a little dry cake batter stuck to it, the cake is done.
‚Äì Take the cake out and let it cool for 5 minutes.
‚Äì Use 1/2 of the cranberry ‚Äúboiled‚Äù water to spread evenly over the cake surface. After about 10 minutes, use a small knife to separate the cake from the sides and remove the cake from the mold.
‚Äì Use the remaining 1/2 of the water to spread all around the cake.
(If you like, you can sprinkle powdered sugar before eating).

Title: Blueberry Pie
Ingredients:
Next, according to the recipe, after shaping, I will sprinkle some brown sugar on top and then bake. But when eating, I realized that if I mix brown sugar with blueberries first and then stuff it into the filling, the sweetness will be more even and delicious.
Eating these cakes is so much fun because you can feel the delicious taste of each intact blueberry, the sweet juice overflowing in every bite.
‚Äì Put flour, powdered sugar and butter in a bowl, use a mixer to beat the mixture until it becomes fluffy like cassava flour.

Title: Orange tart
Ingredients:
‚Äì Sift flour, baking powder and sugar into a bowl and mix well.

‚Äì Add egg yolks, lemon juice and mix well. If the mixture feels a bit dry, you can add 1-2 tsp water.
‚Äì Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm enough to roll. Once rolled and placed in the mold, use a fork to poke holes evenly on the base, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for another 30 minutes.

‚Äì Dissolve custard powder with orange juice in a medium pot, add lemon juice, sugar, eggs, stir gently until dissolved. Place the pot of mixture on the stove, cook over medium high heat for about 5-8 minutes, stirring constantly.
‚Äì After turning off the stove, add butter and orange peel, stir well.

Ingredients:

When it comes to filling the dough, it‚Äôs not difficult. After shaping, roll the dough over a plate of sesame seeds to cover it, then fry it in hot oil. Since the filling is already cooked, just wait until the dough is golden brown.
Because they are homemade, these donuts are not too sweet, just enough to make them delicious. Plus, the oil is drained and absorbed so they are not greasy. They will taste better if you have some friends to "make up for it"

Title: How to make Red Velvet Cake
Ingredients:
@Chrysie: I think the longer the cake is kept in the refrigerator, the better it tastes. My refrigerator is small, so there's not even anything to cover the cake.

Title: Pandan flavored sponge cake roll
Ingredients:
‚Äì Preheat oven to 180 degrees C. Grease baking tray with butter and line bottom with baking paper.
‚Äì Put 20g sugar (1) and egg yolks (+ pandan paste if available) in a bowl, beat the sugar until dissolved (you can beat by hand). Add cooking oil and pandan leaf water, stir until the mixture is well blended.
‚Äì Use a mixer to beat egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually add 30g of sugar, beat until mixture is smooth, shiny and forms ‚Äúpeaks‚Äù.
‚Äì Sift the flour mixture including flour, cornstarch, coconut milk powder and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture, mix gently until combined. Add 1/3 of the egg white mixture and mix gently, continue with 1/3 until finished.
‚Äì Spread the flour mixture evenly on the tray, avoiding creating bubbles in the flour. You can rotate or tap the tray lightly to spread the flour evenly.
‚Äì Bake for about 20 minutes, in the middle of the oven, until the top is golden brown and looks dry.
‚Äì Remove from the oven, let cool for about 5 minutes, pour the cake onto another baking sheet that has been sprinkled with a little dry flour so that the cake does not stick to the paper. At this time, the golden surface of the cake will be in contact with the paper. Peel the paper liner off the cake. Slowly roll the cake while it is still warm, including the paper liner. Leave the cake there to cool. When the cake has cooled, slowly open it, spreading whipped cream or jam inside, slowly peel off the paper and roll the cake again.
When I make it, I just spread some jam and roll it up, then open the cake, spread jam and roll it up, and keep doing that until it's done. It's a bit complicated but I like it when I get it done.

Title: How to make Banh goi
Ingredients:
(In this part, I only give the ratio of making the crust and filling separately, it is not necessary that the number of crusts will be enough to use up all the filling and vice versa)
‚Äì 200g all-purpose flour
‚Äì Cold water
There is no specific ratio for water and flour because an exact ratio is impossible due to the temperature and humidity of the environment. Add water little by little to the flour, knead the dough and then add more water, until the dough becomes elastic, smooth, not sticky, and the dough comes off the sides of the bowl. At first, the dough will feel heavy, but do not add more water because after a while, the dough will soften and become more moist.
Let the dough rest for about 20 minutes, then divide the dough into small pieces, roll each piece into a thin sheet about 1-2mm, and coat with flour if necessary. Use the rim of a rice bowl to press down to cut out a round piece of dough. You should use the finished shell to wrap the cake as soon as you finish making it, because the shell is thin and will dry out and become hard if left in a windy place for a long time, or it will get damp and stick to one piece with another.
‚Äì 300g minced pork
‚Äì 100g vermicelli, soaked until soft, cut into pieces
‚Äì 5-6 wood ear mushrooms, soaked until soft, chopped
‚Äì 1 dozen shiitake mushrooms, soaked until soft, chopped
‚Äì 1 medium-sized jicama, sliced or shredded (you can replace jicama with kohlrabi, which is also delicious)
‚Äì 2 medium carrots, chopped or shredded
‚Äì Fish sauce, pepper, season to taste
Mix all the filling ingredients together.
This depends on each person, depending on their skill and creativity to wrap more or less filling and shape each cake.
Fry the cakes in a small pot or concave pan, deep fry until the crust is golden brown.
Mix a traditional sweet, salty, spicy and sour dipping sauce, like spring roll dipping sauce, with fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, garlic, chili, then add a little chili sauce to the dipping sauce bowl to get a bright red color. Replace vinegar with lemon or kumquat for more aroma if you like.

Title: How to make salted egg sponge cake with shredded pork
Ingredients:
As for the salted eggs, you can buy them ready-made or, if you're more careful, salt the eggs yourself üòÄ (the only problem is that you'll have to wait a while for the eggs to cook :P). Steam the salted eggs or bake them until cooked. Linh likes to crush the salted eggs until they're evenly distributed on the cake, so that when you eat them, there will always be an even amount of salted eggs, instead of placing the whole egg on the cake (it will waste more eggs, but it tastes much better, normally when you buy them outside, you often feel like they're lacking eggs :D).
These are the steps to "arrange" a salted egg floss sponge cake.
1 layer of cake on the bottom, 1 layer of cheese sauce, 1 thin layer of pork floss, then the second layer of cake, drizzle a layer of sauce, then cover evenly with pork floss and salted egg. Voila, we have finished our delicious cake.
Let's go to the kitchen, this cake we make ourselves will definitely be delicious ^^

Title: Common mistakes when baking
Ingredients:
In short, Linh will not choose to make ABC cake if she does not have that ingredient yet. When she does, she will come back to make it later, because Linh always wants to make the most "standard" cake for the cake she intends to make. For example, if someone asks, if she intends to make tiramisu but does not have rum or mascarpone, what should she replace it with? In this case, it is best to wait until you have all the ingredients and then come back to make this cake, because if the tiramisu cake lacks good rum and mascarpone cheese, you will not have the most delicious cake.
This is the most common mistake people make, because they are afraid of not mixing enough. You should read the recipe carefully, pay attention to words like: mix until well combined, beat until soft, beat until stiff, mix gently, mix vigorously, mix slowly, mix quickly... and how light or vigorous, how fast or slow, this will give you a lot of experience when baking.
Hehe, I think this error does not need to be explained further. Sometimes I do not know what you should do differently, especially when you are new to baking. Later, when you have more experience, you may not need to follow each step closely, you can draw your own experiences. But when you are new to baking, just follow the instructions as I did, it will limit mistakes a lot.
Linh has briefly summarized the common errors above, hoping that it will be helpful to you. Linh will add more to the article if she remembers anything important that is missing.
Wish you all to bake many delicious and beautiful cakes ^^

Title: How to make Hong Kong Pandan Sponge Cake
Ingredients:
But Linh still wanted the cake to be a little more special, a little more fragrant and moist, so Linh decided to grind some pandan leaves instead of fresh milk and adjust the recipe a little. Here is the result: the pandan sponge cake made based on the Hong Kong sponge cake recipe is softer, moister, has a light green color and a light pandan scent. The cake is indeed much more interesting.
Linh decorated this cake for her youngest child‚Äôs 2nd birthday. There wasn‚Äôt much to decorate, so it was okay. In the evening, she blew out the candles and sang Happy Birthday to the house, which made her very happy üôÇ
You guys should try making this sponge cake ^^

Title: 4 ways to make Flan ‚Äì Creme caramel simple but delicious
Ingredients:
The main ingredients to make flan are only sugar, eggs, condensed milk or fresh milk. Later, people created more and more variations to create new flavors for flan such as cocoa flan, coffee flan, passion fruit flan, coconut milk flan, chocolate flan...
The tools to make flan are also very simple, just need a small pot to cook the sugar water until it melts into a cockroach brown color, a pot to heat the milk, mix it with the eggs, then divide it into small cups. Finally, put it in a steamer or oven.
For those who do not have an oven, you can completely make flan by steaming. You can use a specialized steamer, or a normal homemade cooker (by placing a bowl underneath, pouring water, placing a steamer on top of the bowl, like we often steam sticky rice or steamed buns). You can also try making flan by steaming in a rice cooker.
When steaming flan, you need to be a little more skillful and meticulous so that the surface of the flan does not have water dripping down and making the surface of the cake pitted. You need to cover the mouth of the cups with a clean towel, and use another towel to cover the mouth of the steamer so that the rising water does not drip down onto the surface of the cake. Occasionally open the lid of the pot to let some of the water in the lid escape, reducing the risk of dripping onto the surface of the cake.
After steaming for enough time (the time depends on the size of your container, shallow or deep, so there is no fixed time), you check by shaking gently to see if the flan has set. When hot, the flan will feel a bit too soft, but when it cools down and especially after being chilled, the flan will set and become firmer.
When making flan with an oven, we often call it baking in a water bath. Baking in a water bath is placing cups containing the flan mixture in a baking tray and pouring hot baking powder into the tray, then putting it in the oven and baking at the temperature and time according to the recipe instructions.
Making flan in the oven is much easier. You don‚Äôt need to cover the cup, just put it in the oven, just make sure the water in the baking tray doesn‚Äôt dry out too much.
Flan made by baking in a water bath in an oven usually produces a denser and firmer product, with almost no pitting on the surface, and the cake is more beautiful and smoother when baked.
Many people also call it caramel. My method is very simple, no need to add any other ingredients besides sugar and water.
Step 1: Put the amount of sugar according to the recipe into a thick-bottomed pot (preferably a stainless steel pot).
Step 2: Pour water to cover the sugar.
Step 3: Place the pot on the stove and simmer. And just leave the pot of sugar on the stove, do not touch chopsticks, spoons or any other utensils while cooking, leave it there, occasionally look at it until the sugar starts to change color, then take it out.
Very simple right, and I always cook beautiful and delicious caramel just by cooking this way.
Because the thick-bottomed stainless steel pot retains heat very well, the remaining heat in the pot will continue to change the color of the sugar, which will naturally turn into a beautiful caramel color. Therefore, be careful not to put the pot on the stove and continue to cook, because if you still put it on the stove and cook until the sugar turns caramel color before removing it, the remaining heat of the pot will burn the sugar very quickly. Making caramel sugar water this way is very easy, extremely simple, and the product is always extremely beautiful üôÇ
There are recipes for making flan with fresh milk, some flan recipes use only sweetened condensed milk, and some recipes combine both fresh milk and condensed milk. So, is fresh milk or condensed milk, or both, better for making flan?
After making many types and recipes, I have concluded that any type of milk can be used. The difference in taste or deliciousness is not ‚Äúobvious‚Äù so you can freely follow your preferences or convenience. If you have fresh milk at home, use fresh milk. If you have condensed milk, use condensed milk.
The important thing to make the final flan product delicious, smooth, moderately sweet, soft or dense depends on the recipe, more precisely the ratio of ingredients, and the careful making process to avoid any mistakes.
Personally, I often use unsweetened fresh milk because I can control the amount of sugar, thereby making the flan with moderate sweetness, suitable for the taste of the whole family. Sweetened condensed milk from different milk brands also has different levels of sweetness.
Flan is delicious, easy to eat, good for children and adults, but eating too much is not good. Flan is generally nutritious, because the ingredients contain a lot of milk and eggs, which are both good foods. Adding sugar makes flan contain a lot of energy. Therefore , you should not eat too much, too often, especially if you need to lose weight. People who need to gain weight can eat more regularly. Children who go to school and exercise a lot, eating a small cup every day is also very good.
How long can flan be kept?
If after baking, you cover it tightly, put it in the refrigerator, and maintain a stable low temperature below 5 degrees Celsius, you can keep the cake for about a week.
If the temperature of the refrigerator compartment changes frequently due to frequent opening and closing, the shelf life of the cake will only be a few days, sometimes only 2-3 days.
Spoiled flan will turn sour and become inedible.
I have tried many flan recipes, and this is the one I like best. Following this recipe, the flan is dense, smooth, and can be cut into pieces without breaking into pieces, and is still very soft when eaten.
Keep these flan cups in the fridge to cool down, eating one or two cups a day is great.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 250g eggs (without shell)

Title: Names and distinctions of Western cakes
Ingredients:
If we "trace" the origin in detail, we must mention the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who invented the oven, and centuries later, it was the ancestors of the Romans.
In this article, I do not intend to delve into the historical aspects, but only dare to humbly present the basic distinctions between the names of European and American cakes, which are increasingly attractive to many Vietnamese who want to try and make them. I can only mention the common names of familiar cakes, but there are so many specific names that I cannot know them all.
All products related to the use of flour, eggs, fat and baking are collectively called PASTRY. Therefore, the chef who specializes in making these products is called Pastry Chef. The word ‚Äúcake‚Äù that Vietnamese people often call ‚Äúbanh ngot‚Äù is just a very narrow segment in Pastry.
Distinguish between 2 types:
‚Äì Regular bread: (lean yeast bread) contains only flour and water, may or may not use yeast, so some types of bread need to go through a fermentation process and some do not.
‚Äì ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù bread: (rich yeast bread) the word ‚Äúsweet‚Äù is translated quite loosely, these are types of bread that, in addition to flour, water, yeast, use other ingredients such as sugar, fat, milk, milk powder, so the bread has many more delicious flavors and textures different from regular bread.
‚Äì This is the general name for bread-like cakes that do not go through the natural fermentation and fermentation process (about a few hours) but use chemicals that cause rapid rising, so they are made very quickly. Quick bread also often has a softer and ‚Äúricher‚Äù texture, without the chewiness of bread that is naturally leavened.
‚Äì Quick breads include cakes with names such as: muffins, scones, loaf bread, coffee cakes.
+ Muffins: are small, cup-shaped cakes that can be served in a paper cup or not. Sweet or savory muffins are available and eaten without icing/frosting.
+ Scone: cone-shaped, flat triangle.
+ Loaf: rectangular shape
+ Coffee cake: made with round, square, rectangular molds, etc. are suitable cakes to eat while drinking tea, during tea breaks.
These are cakes that are fried in fat. Common types:
‚Äì Doughnuts (donut): round wheel-shaped cakes, cooked by deep-frying. Nowadays, there are also doughnuts made by baking to reduce the fat in the cake. Donuts are often decorated with candy, sugar, dried fruit, chocolate, almonds and nuts on the surface of the cake to make them more delicious and attractive.
‚Äì Pancake: a flat, thin pancake cooked by brushing a thin layer of oil/butter on the surface of the pan. There are many types of pancakes with different flavors. Pancakes are served with butter and maple syrup, fresh fruit and whipped cream.
‚Äì Crepe: similar to pancake but much thinner. Crepe is often eaten with jams, fresh fruit, whipped cream, and syrup.
‚Äì Waffles: thin, flat cakes and usually made in separate molds. Waffles are also served with fresh fruit, whipped cream, and fruit jam.
‚Äì Fritters: sweet and salty cakes depending on the ingredients used, no fixed shape, cooked by deep frying.
These two types of cakes are easily confused with each other.
‚Äì Pie: a closed crust with filling inside, all are called pie crust. The dough for pie crust is divided into 2 parts, 1 part is rolled out thinly as the base, the filling is placed inside, then the remaining part is rolled out thinly to cover the top, the edges are sealed and a few holes are made on the surface crust to let steam escape during baking.
‚Äì Tart: a pie without a crust, baked with the filling exposed. Tart is a special type of pie that does not need a crust to cover the filling.
There are both sweet and savory tarts and pies.
The general name for cakes with the highest fat and sweetness content among baked goods. Cake making requires a lot of precision in measuring ingredients. The texture of the cake is usually soft, spongy, rich in flavor and cakes are baked and presented in many different shapes.
The simplest type of cake consists of flour, butter, eggs, and milk. Vietnamese people often call it sponge cake or ga-to cake. The word Ga-to comes from the French word - Gateau, meaning Cake.
+ Chiffon: use cooking oil as the fat ingredient in the cake. Both egg whites and yolks are used but separated during the making process.
+ Angel food: only use beaten egg whites, no fat. The cake is light and white like cotton.
+ Devil food: cake with black chocolate color, using butter as fat. It is a type of cake using butter (butter cake)
The word cookie means ‚Äúsmall cake‚Äù. There are cookies made from flour mixtures quite similar to cakes, but in most cases, cookies have a low water content. Cookies are very diverse, soft, moist, dry, crispy, chewy, spongy, hard.
Cookies are a type of cake that is eaten daily in the family, often served with tea or given to children as a snack. Cookies are easy to make and come in many varieties. Linh thinks that mothers should prepare many different jars of cookies at home, serve them to their husbands during tea time and give them to their children when they are hungry, or have a few during the day.
Cream puff is the Vietnamese name for Choux pastry, which originated from France. Choux pastry is one of the most famous types of pastry. The pastry has a soft, slightly chewy, hollow shell to be stuffed with different flavors of cream inside. From this choux pastry, the pastry is transformed into other shapes such as Eclair, Cream Puff, etc.
Eclair Cake
The name "thousand layers" is the Vietnamese name for Puff Pastry, which is a type of dough consisting of extremely many layers of flour and butter mixed together, up to several hundred layers. After baking, the cake is usually light and expands into many layers of dough, if skillful, we can even separate them into layers. The most common application of puff pastry that we often see is Croisant Cake. This is also one of the most difficult cakes to make, a challenge for home-made bakers.
Thousand-layer crust is used to make many savory cakes and extremely attractive desserts.
Strawberry puff pastry

Title: Honey Castella ‚Äì Kasutera honey cake
Ingredients:
In the 16th century, this type of cake was introduced to Japan by the Portuguese, and since then it has become a "specialty" of the Nagasaki region. The traditional mold for making this type of cake is a bottomless wooden mold, but most of us do not have this type of mold. To somewhat simulate the wooden mold, I followed the instructions online and used two square molds, size 18cm with a solid bottom and 20cm with a removable bottom. Place the 18cm mold inside the 20cm mold, and in the space between the two molds, we will insert 4 pieces of cardboard cut to the size of the mold and cover it with aluminum foil. Why is it necessary to be so ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù? Because this type of cake needs to be baked for a long time (about 40 ‚Äì 50 minutes) at a relatively low temperature (160 degrees Celsius), so that the cake rises slowly and maintains a stable structure. Limiting direct contact of the metal mold with heat also helps the cake to be less dry. The cake is baked at the lowest position in the oven, the purpose is also to let the bottom surface be cooked to a golden brown color like the surface of the cake and the sides of the cake will not burn. However, even though I tried baking this way several times, the bottom of my cake still could not achieve such a thick layer of brown cake. Anyway, this is not a must for this type of cake.

Title: Pandan Kaya (Traditional Malaysian Pandan Jam)
Ingredients:
Kaya is naturally very sweet, so when I make it, I adjust the amount of sugar so that when mixed with bread, it has a moderate sweetness. Both children and adults in my family love this kaya. I put it in a small jar and gave it to my weaning-age grandchild, and he ate it very excitedly ^^.
To make pandan juice, wash the pandan leaves, chop them finely, then put them in a blender and blend until smooth. Then use a clean towel to squeeze out the pandan juice. The darker the pandan juice, the darker the kaya and the stronger the pandan scent. So how do you make the pandan juice stronger? You need to chop the pandan leaves into small pieces so that the blender can blend quickly and easily, and add just enough water so that the blender can blend without being sluggish. If you add too much water, the pandan juice will be diluted and bland.
Ingredient:

Title: How to make moon cake
Ingredients:
Perhaps children enjoy moon cakes more than adults, because they are sweet, and you can freely make different colors for the moon cake crust, because children like colors. As for moon cakes, I give up, they only have one shiny golden brown color.
Talking about the filling, banh chung and banh nuong are similar, the difference is in the crust. Banh chung crust is made from cooked sticky rice flour, so in fact, the finished banh chung can be eaten immediately, simply by mixing the flour with water and sugar. Traditional banh chung is usually white with a characteristic cool, gentle aroma, which is the scent of grapefruit essential oil. Nowadays, modern banh chung is made with more colors and more flavors: green banh chung is often flavored with green tea or pandan leaves, pink banh chung is flavored with strawberries, yellow banh chung is flavored with orange, mango, brown banh chung is flavored with chocolate, coffee...
The batch of mooncakes I made today is pandan-flavored mooncakes. Fresh pandan leaves are finely ground and the juice is squeezed to make the water to mix with the dough. The dough will be dyed green and have a very natural aroma. The pandan juice is mixed into the mung bean filling, the filling is also green and has a very pleasant aroma.

Title: How to make sugar water for mooncakes
Ingredients:
With the same recipe for making sugar water, the same instructions, however, not everyone can make bottles of sugar water with the same color. Some people make dark color, some people make light color, some people make sugar water that after a few days has "re-sugared", meaning that there are sugar crystals that settle to the bottom and form many small particles.
The darker the sugar water used to make mooncakes, the darker the color of the crust when mixed into the dough, the crust will be from the beginning, instead of the white or ivory color that we all want our mooncake crust to be evenly dark. Just boil it right, the newly boiled sugar water will have the same color as fish sauce or lipton tea, let me say it like that so you can easily imagine. Then, the longer we leave it, the darker the color of the sugar water will be, and the sugar water will be very thick, not runny. This is the color of my sugar water bottle next to my cup of tea.
After boiling sugar water many times, I have drawn the following conclusions:
‚Äì You should use brown sugar (also known as plum blossom sugar), the sugar water will have a more beautiful color than using white sugar.
‚Äì You should boil the sugar water in a thick-bottomed pot, and the pot should be large and have walls higher than the sugar water. When boiling, the sugar water will not overflow, and the evaporation rate of the water will also be faster.
‚Äì Boil sugar water over medium heat.
‚Äì During the entire boiling process, do not use any tools to stir the sugar water. The only tool used is a chopstick to measure the sugar water level to see how low it is.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 1kg brown sugar
‚Äì 1 liter of water
‚Äì Juice of 1 lemon
‚Äì 1 tsp lye water
‚Äì 2 tsp filtered water
‚Äì 50g malt

Title: Answers to questions about moon cake ingredients
Ingredients:
Moon cakes are both easy and difficult, because the ingredients alone are already a mess. And once you have taken the trouble to ‚Äúarrange‚Äù, every woman wants to make cakes with many different flavors and fillings, so the already messy ingredients are even more messy, because there is a little bit of each. In this article, I hope to summarize most of those messy things so that you, especially those who are new to making moon cakes, will have a rough idea of what you will have to prepare so that this Mid-Autumn Festival you can make beautiful and delicious cakes by yourself, as surprise gifts for relatives and friends.
A. Ingredients for making pie crust.
1. Flour.
The crust is made from wheat flour, the common wheat flour that we often see sold in supermarkets, or easily bought in markets. There is nothing special about this type of flour that needs to be noted.
2. Lye water
Is an ingredient used to boil sugar water to make moon cakes, and used to add to the dough of the cake. As the name suggests, the nature of natural lye water in the past was made as follows: the ash was taken after burning firewood, wood, mixed with clean water, let the ash settle and decant the clear water. This water is lye water, in the North, during Tet, many rural households often make banh gio themselves to eat to make it easier to "digest" the heavy dishes of Tet. Lye water is one of the food additives used quite a lot, due to that need, today lye water sold on the market is not natural lye water but chemical lye water, usually NaOH or KOH. The amount of lye water used in a recipe for boiling sugar water is very small, with such a small amount it is not toxic, especially after being cooked and baked. It is only poisonous when used directly (for example, if accidentally drunk, because it is white like water or wine, many people who do not store it carefully have mistaken it and drunk it).
Lye water is used to caramelize sugar for baked cakes, which helps to soften the crust of the baked cake and give it an even dark color. However, many women are afraid of the toxicity of lye water and throw it away, instead adding a little "caramel water" to give the caramelized sugar a nice color. You can do it any way, depending on your choice, because I know that to have a cake with a nice and even dark color, the sugar water factor alone is not enough.
3. Caramelized sugar water
This is sugar water boiled according to a certain ratio of ingredients. The longer this sugar water is boiled before use, the better it tastes, and the darker the color of the sugar will be. After the end of the Mid-Autumn Festival, many diligent and careful women immediately boil several batches of sugar water and save them for next year.
Nowadays, ready-made sugar syrup for mooncakes is also becoming popular, especially when you are too busy to boil sugar syrup, or are afraid of the hassle, or run out of sugar syrup while making it.
B. Ingredients for making moon cake crust
1. Moon cake flour
The flour used to make the moon cake crust is cooked glutinous rice flour, because moon cake is a type of cake that does not need to be baked. There are many types of moon cake flour on the market, regular and special, but I think if you are going to bother making moon cake at home, you should choose special moon cake flour, which is more fragrant and of higher quality, to make the cake the most delicious.
2. Sugar water for moon cakes
Making moon cakes also requires boiling sugar water, however, making sugar water for moon cakes is much quicker and easier than making sugar water for baked cakes, just boil sugar and water and it's ready to use.
3. Grapefruit flower water
The mooncake crust has a characteristic light fragrance, which is thanks to grapefruit flower water. Just add a small amount of grapefruit flower water to the mooncake dough, adding too much will make the smell too strong.
C. Ingredients for making moon cake filling
1. Beans, peas, lotus seeds, sweet potatoes, taro
This is the main ingredient to make the fillings, from which we have the following fillings: green bean filling, red bean filling, lotus seed filling, taro filling, sweet potato filling.
Among the above fillings, green beans and lotus seeds are the most commonly used, because this is the basic ‚Äúbase‚Äù for mixing fillings with other flavors. For example, from green bean filling, you can make chocolate green bean filling, pandan green bean filling‚Ä¶ by adding cocoa powder to the filling, or adding pandan essence (ground from pandan leaves or buying a pre-mixed essential oil bottle), or green tea lotus seed filling (use green tea powder mixed into white lotus filling).
2. Salted eggs
Many people like to have salted eggs in their cake filling. You can salt the eggs yourself, or buy salted eggs at the market. If you salt the eggs yourself, you need to salt them about 20-25 days before making the cake.
3. Seeds: to enhance the flavor of the filling, for example: white sesame, black sesame, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds... peeled and roasted. The filling with these seeds will be more fragrant and delicious, when biting into the seeds, it gives a crunchy, crunchy feeling, quite interesting.
4. Malt:
Maltose is a thick, sticky sugar used in the baking process to make the filling stick together better and keep the filling moist.
D. Ingredients for mixed filling
There are many ways to prepare mixed fillings, depending on each person's preference. Here I list the ingredients that people most often use for mixed fillings, including: pumpkin jam, lotus seed jam, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, white sesame, lemon leaves, ham, Chinese sausage, lemon leaves, lard balls (thinly sliced lard cooked with sugar until firm), salted eggs, ...
Above, I have reviewed the ingredients that are often needed to prepare for a busy and successful moon cake making season. There are many moon cake making instructions shared online by women, you can search and find a satisfactory recipe to start making cakes. I am also busy buying ingredients to make cakes ^^

Title: Black sesame rice cookies
Ingredients:
Making rice cookies is really fun, because before making it, I couldn't imagine what the result would be, at least before following the recipe in the book, I could see the pictures. While adding the ingredients, I had to be a little careful with each one, gradually getting a decent dough mixture to make cookies. I only added a little butter to the cake to get the aroma, added 1 egg yolk, and added a little sugar. I expected to make thin and crispy cookies. When I put them in the oven, baked for 15 minutes, I saw that the dough didn't "move" at all: it didn't change color (the dough was still ivory white), it didn't spread out (normally I'm used to cookies automatically spreading out more or less), but this dough ball, after 15 minutes of baking at high temperature (200 degrees Celsius), was still the same, only the surface of the dough was dry and shriveled. Like this, it definitely wouldn't be crispy cookies, but it would be chewy like steamed rice cakes. Thinking about it, I took out the entire tray of cakes, used a thick-bottomed stainless steel cup to press each cake flat to make it thinner (as I originally intended). Strangely, right from the first one, I was interested. After the cake's surface dries and is pressed out, it will create natural cracks on the cake. So without hesitation, I used a stainless steel cup to press all the dry-surfaced cakes flat, then put them in the oven until they turned golden brown, at that time the cake was dry and crispy, and very fragrant. I was very excited and curious about this new type of cake, tried it and found it very good. BMC and my husband both praised the cake for being delicious and having a different taste compared to the usual "Western" cookies with a lot of butter that I usually make.
I feel satisfied because I have made use of the leftover ingredients, and from that I have made a pretty interesting and unique cake. My rice and peanut residue after making roasted rice water weighed 350g. If you make rice water and squeeze out more water to make the residue drier, then you need to reduce the flour when making this cake. If your rice and peanut residue is still too watery, you should try to squeeze out more water, otherwise you will have to use more flour to knead, if there is too much flour, you will have to increase the other ingredients accordingly.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 350g rice residue and peanuts (after making roasted rice water)
‚Äì 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
‚Äì 50g black sesame, roasted

Title: How to make Tomato Sauce for Pizza
Ingredients:
For my family, olive oil is only used when making Western dishes, because I don't want the dish to lose its characteristic flavor. Many times, when we spend time trying to make a new dish but replace the ingredients, we won't really know what the dish is really like. So the ingredients will be the first thing we respect, trying to find the right and sufficient ones, if not enough, we will wait until we have enough to cook. Not to mention that cooking a dish properly also depends on whether we are good at cooking or not, if we are not good at cooking, even if we have enough ingredients, we still cook a dish that is not very good. I choose Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the strongest flavor, and I usually buy a large bottle to get a cheaper price than buying a small bottle, because my family often cooks Western dishes so we don't have to worry about not using it all up.
If you pay attention, you will also see that tomato sauce, or tomato sauce bought in supermarkets (the kind used for pizza, ready-made pasta) is often darker red, because people add food coloring during production. Just look at the bottle of Tomato Ketchup, in my life I have never seen a tomato with such a dark red color :D, especially when cooked, mixed with a few other ingredients, the red color of the tomato can sometimes fade. However, it cannot be denied that the color of food greatly affects the perception of the deliciousness of the dish. Therefore, with tomatoes, I often choose to buy ripe red tomatoes to make, not orange tomatoes or green tomatoes.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 500g ripe tomatoes
‚Äì 1/2 onion, finely chopped
‚Äì 4-5 cloves of garlic, minced
‚Äì 5 tbs olive oil
‚Äì 1 tbsp dried oregano

Title: How to make fried mozzarella cheese sticks
Ingredients:
I'm being long-winded again :P, because today I want to prolong the happy feeling of the morning a little bit, to write about this cheese sticks - a dish that is no longer strange to many people, but still strange to many people. I rarely eat at fast food restaurants outside, so I don't know how this dish tastes when eaten outside. I made it according to my imagination, following a few recipes shared online, and the result is also a quite interesting dish, extremely rich, fatty, very attractive because I like cheese ^^
Making this dish is very simple, and I also chose a very simple recipe. After making half of the mozzarella cheese, I suddenly remembered the packets of Western dried spices, so I mixed them with breadcrumbs to continue frying the rest, and thus the cheese pieces had more attractive flavors and aromas.

Title: Chocolate mousse cheesecake
Ingredients:
Making this cake takes a bit of time, because we have to make each part of the cake by ourselves, and then we can continue with the next part. So it takes a day for the cake to be completed, which is really worth it for a delicious cake. Linh was so happy when this cake was completed beautifully and deliciously as she had imagined, and was really willing to share this cake with her friends.
An extremely romantic cake ‚Äì Linh thinks so, from the flavor, color to the feeling when eating, the feeling when looking at the cake. The cake crust is thin, crispy, rich in the fragrant cocoa flavor. The cheesecake is soft, fragrant, not too thick, the sour taste is very cool, typical of cream cheese. The chocolate mousse is extremely creamy, light. On top is a layer of chocolate ganache that is soft and rich in chocolate flavor. In short, this is a very enchanting cake.
This cake should have been made with a springform round pan, which would have been easier to work with, but Linh‚Äôs pan is broken (after 4 years of diligently serving its owner ‚Äì Linh loved it so much), so Linh used a regular round pan with a removable base. It‚Äôs a simple aluminum pan, much cheaper than a springform pan, but it‚Äôs just as effective. And Linh was able to make a crisp cake like this ^^

Title: How to make Black Forest chocolate cake ‚Äì The Dark Forest
Ingredients:
Linh was very satisfied with the cake, feeling satisfied because it was the kind of cake she had wanted to try making for a long time and finally made it (because this cake is actually very easy to make). Linh was even happier when her friends praised the cake and made it delicious. Linh had eaten this cake twice at the bakery outside, but both times she was just curious to see how the cake tasted, and when she made it at home this time, she could clearly analyze the difference.
When writing this post for the black forest cake, Linh still had the same feeling of her daughter‚Äôs birthday party. Her close friends and adoptive parents came to celebrate her birthday. After the small meal, everyone ate cake with black tea, and enjoyed piano music from children to classic performed by Nguyen ‚Äì the husband of Linh‚Äôs close friend, a handsome and talented man who has played the piano for 20 years ‚Äì who is also In‚Äôs parents. The small living room became warmer and more romantic with the piano melodies, sometimes cheerful and bustling, sometimes gentle and soft. The daughter was very happy, running around the living room, sometimes jumping, sometimes dancing, sometimes humming along to the music, sometimes excitedly jumping and screaming loudly‚Ä¶ among the parents, aunts and uncles, who gave her so much love and affection.
Linh would like to come here to thank everyone once again, thank Hai Linh and Thuy, thank Hieu and Yen, thank Nguyen's father, Dung's mother, Hung's father, Tuan's father... for working with Linh's mother to create a beautiful and meaningful birthday party for her daughter.
To make this cake, the most special ingredients to prepare are cherries soaked in syrup and fresh cherries (to decorate the cake beautifully, if you don't have fresh cherries, you can use canned cherries). In addition, there is a special type of wine, which is Kirsch, or any type of cherry brandy, however, Linh searched all over the metro but couldn't find these types of wine, so Linh had to buy a bottle of Sherry to replace it. Of course, if you don't like to put wine in your cake, you can also skip the wine, but Linh always wants to make it as standard as possible to get the closest flavor to the perfect cake.
One more thing with homemade cake is that I will use cherries to cover the cream layer between the two layers of cake, the cake will be enjoyed with a lot of cherry flavor, something you will not see when eating this type of cake outside.
Ingredients: (1 round mold 20cm)
‚Äì 300-400g drained canned cherries (the kind soaked in syrup)
‚Äì 4 tbs alcohol (kirsch, cherry brandy, here Linh uses sherry)
‚Äì 150ml cherry syrup
‚Äì 40g white sugar
* Genoise chocolate:
‚Äì 60g cake flour
‚Äì 1/4 tsp salt
‚Äì 30g cocoa powder
‚Äì 4 eggs
‚Äì 100g sugar
‚Äì 1 tsp vanilla extract
‚Äì 45g unsalted butter, melted
* Decor:
‚Äì 400ml whipping cream
‚Äì 50g sugar
‚Äì dark chocolate chips
‚Äì fresh cherries

Title: Buttermilk raspberry cake
Ingredients:
However, with this mischievous angel in the kitchen, you will often hear exclamations like: ‚ÄúOh my god, my child!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh my child!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh my child!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh my god, please, please!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh my god, what are you doing?‚Äù every time you find your angel doing something you don‚Äôt like at all. There are things that make you laugh happily because your child has grown up, has done something you didn‚Äôt think he could do, and of course you will have to accept cleaning up the consequences of breakages, spills, even ruining the cake you were making, changing all of your child‚Äôs clothes, etc.
Linh does not hesitate to let her child into the kitchen, and Linh really enjoys seeing the excitement on her face when she is playing and exploring, learning new things in her own way. Of course, safety in the kitchen always needs to be ensured, and I always have to keep an eye on her. Sharp objects, glass, hot water, etc. must be kept away from her, but she still sets a record of breaking her mother's bowls or cups every week üòÄ
When Mom took a picture of the food, I also rushed in to "give a hand", also picked up this, picked up that, in this case I only bothered Mom, making Mom always have to beg: "Please sit still and watch Mom take a picture to finish!". I nodded as if I understood, but as soon as Mom raised her phone to take a picture, I shook Mom's hand to ask her to take a picture!!! After Mom finished taking a picture and picked up the plate, I went to dust off the things Mom had scattered on the table :)), pointed to the ground and said to Mom "Mom, this is dirty!", and I would go find a broom to sweep the house!
But still, it is very interesting to have a child in the house. And when the child makes a mess and annoys, it is also happiness üôÇ
The cake that Linh made this time was a cake with raspberries. It must be said that the sour taste of Raspberry when combined with sweet cakes makes the sweetness of the cake much more appealing. The sour and fragrant feeling of raspberry balances the sweetness of the cake, making the sweetness very mild and cool. The thin layer of sugar sprinkled evenly on the surface of the cake creates a slightly crunchy feeling when eating a piece of cake in the mouth, very interesting. The cake is not too sweet.
When making this cake, Linh mixed the raspberries into the batter, so they all sank to the bottom. Linh thinks that if you make this cake, you should not mix the fruit into the batter, but spread the fruit evenly on the surface of the cake, so the cake will look more beautiful with the red spots of the fruit floating on the golden brown background of the cake. The cake is very suitable and delicious when eaten with whipped cream (no sugar).

Title: Lemon poppy seeds muffin
Ingredients:
This is the first time I have used poppy seeds in baking. This muffin with poppy seeds is very easy to make, like many other muffins, adding the aroma and mild sour taste of lemon and yogurt makes the cake very fragrant, the cake Not too sweet. The poppy seeds when chewed give the feeling of breaking apart, the more slowly we eat each piece of cake, the more we will feel the unique flavor of the poppy seeds. Very interesting.

Title: Dark chocolate coconut cookies
Ingredients:
Back to this type of cookies. Chocolate and coconut is a classic combination, these two ingredients are used together in many different types of cakes. Vietnamese people tend (because they are used to the synonym of biscuits - translated from cookies - which are packaged cakes sold in supermarkets) to like cookies to be dry and crispy, however in the West, even with cookies, many people like to eat them while they are still warm, like the cake to be soft, moist, baked until just done, the edges of the cake are crispy but the middle is still soft. With this type of cookies, if you want the cake to be crispier and drier, you can extend the baking time.

Title: Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Pancake
Ingredients:
Pancakes are quite different, that is, using baking powder, and when ‚Äúfrying‚Äù in a pan, only a little bit of butter is spread on the pan. This time I made pancakes with peanut butter because I really like this peanut dish. Pancakes are usually only slightly sweet, served with syrups or jams. With this type, I like to enjoy it ‚Äúwithout‚Äù, it is very interesting to feel the rich aroma of peanut butter.

Title: Let's Make Easter Bread
Ingredients:
(playing with Angry Birds ^^)
So I had to correct my mistake by adding more flour to adjust the ratio. And then knead the dough, and then let it rise, and the bread came out fragrant and delicious. So I have a completely new recipe. There are many different recipes for Easter Bread, this is a recipe with a high ratio of fat, sugar, eggs and milk, because this is a type of sweet bread. The bread is very fragrant, delicious, rich, and has a golden color.
When mixing the dough, you will find that the mixture is very sticky and soft. If you knead it by hand, it will be quite difficult because it is too sticky. When shaping the cake, you will also have to use a lot of flour, but don't worry because it is okay, you just use flour to prevent sticking and make it easier to work with. Because the ratio of fat, sugar, and eggs is quite high, the dough will rise slower. The day I made this cake, the weather was a bit cold and it took more than 1.5 hours for the dough to double in size after the first proofing.
Below is the recipe that I have adjusted.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 1/2 cup fresh milk
‚Äì 1/2 cup unsalted butter
‚Äì 1/2 cup margarine
‚Äì 1/2 cup sugar
‚Äì 12g bread yeast
‚Äì 1/4 cup warm water
‚Äì 1 tsp sugar
‚Äì 3 eggs (small size)
‚Äì 4 cups all-purpose flour
‚Äì 3/4 tsp baking powder
‚Äì 3/4 tsp salt
‚Äì A little egg white (to spread on cake)
‚Äì 1 ‚Äì 2 tbs sesame

Title: Almond sweet buns
Ingredients:
Another time, a girl came to my store and asked if I sold baking additives. I asked back: What are baking additives? She said: I went to a baking school, people use baking additives to put in cakes because that's what makes the cake rise and fluff. I wondered: Are you talking about baking powder and baking soda? She calmly said: No, I know those two, but there are other baking additives, the place where I studied baking said they had to have them, and if you want to buy them, you have to buy a whole 8kg box, it's only 20k/kg, but if you buy that much, when will you ever use it all up? (Oh my god!!!).
So I have a message for you bakers: follow the recipe shared online, get it from a reliable source, and do it exactly as the recipe requires. Don't arbitrarily replace or add or subtract if you don't have experience and don't understand the rules of baking. In addition, some cakes require a lot of experience to verify, such as bread, so it takes a lot of practice to be successful. When it comes to baking, don't be in a hurry. Do it right, and you will have delicious cakes to enjoy.

Ingredients:
Normally, I don't like to eat bread sold in grocery stores or supermarkets, because I've made my own bread, and I know what the real bread is like. Eating these pieces of bread just feels different, it's natural that they're not delicious (you get what you pay for!!!). So I used this pre-made bread to make this dish, the bread was clearly "improved" because the bread was crispier when baked, more fragrant (it was hot), especially with bacon and cheddar to "elevate" the bread ^^

Title: Bacon Toast
Ingredients:
The World Cup football matches are coming very soon, promising many gatherings of friends and family to watch football. Therefore, 2!Dep newspaper has ordered to make quick snacks to serve those football parties. There is no need for a big feast with lots of wine and beer, these light dishes are not intended for men to slowly sip one glass after another, but are just dishes that are meant to "push", contributing to the fun of the meals when everyone gathers in front of the TV to watch exciting football matches. Watching and eating at the same time is a pleasure, not only adults like to watch football and nibble on something at the same time. When I was a kid, during the Euro or World Cup seasons, the kids in my neighborhood often invited each other to stay up to watch at someone's house, and we would pool money to buy "pops" in the afternoon and save them for the night to eat and watch together ^^
Ingredient:

Title: How to make Hamburger
Ingredients:
To make the cake more attractive, when grilling the beef, I spread barbecue sauce on the surface of the cake, ensuring it is extremely delicious. (The bbq sauce is also homemade, delicious and very safe). Finely chopped onion mix well and also beef, so to avoid the cake from falling apart during baking, you should cut the onion as finely as possible (only the person cutting it will have tears and runny nose :D) My family I don't have a grill so I use a non-stick pan.
One more thing to note is that in the ingredients section, you must use the right type of mustard powder (not the ‚Äúglue‚Äù mustard sold in tubes or jars), to fully enjoy the special deliciousness of the burger. The burger is a combination of many special spices that when you eat it, you can feel each flavor very differently, which is the taste of mustard, worcestershire, and the smell of bbq sauce (supermarkets sell bottles of bbq sauce).
The size of the bun depends on the size of the bun you make or you buy ready-made buns, from which you shape the beef burgers accordingly. My burger is simple with tomatoes, lettuce and a slice of cheese for each one. I was full after eating one.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 500g ground beef
salt, pepper
‚Äì 1 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard powder
‚Äì 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
‚Äì 2 egg yolks
‚Äì 3 tbs ketchup
‚Äì finely chopped onion (add more or less onion depending on your preference)
‚Äì cassava flour (optional ‚Äì if you use more cassava flour, reduce the beef)
‚Äì bbq sauce (to brush on the cake surface)
‚Äì sliced cheese (cheddar or mozzarella)
‚Äì sliced tomatoes
‚Äì Lettuce whole or chopped

Title: Delicious chocolate cake recipe ‚Äì Chocolate torte
Ingredients:
Because making a cake for a birthday (important and meaningful), I believe that any type of cake must be a bit elaborate. After flipping through the book for a while, I decided to make this cake. I had never made it before, and had to do 4 steps, not to mention shaping and decorating the cake, and I had not tried it yet, so it was a bit risky. Luckily, the cake was delicious beyond imagination (I'm not saying it's too bragging, but the cake was invited to many people to try and everyone praised it as delicious, hehe). My family only has 1 round mold, so I had to divide the cake recipe in half and make 2 batches of cake. If you have 2 round molds, make the full recipe and bake them at the same time, which is faster and less tiring.
According to the original recipe, the cake uses a lot of sugar, so when I made it, I had to cut down quite a bit. Then I made chocolate syrup according to the recipe online, which also used a lot of sugar, and I also had to reduce it. The result was quite good, the cake was sweet and had a strong chocolate flavor, not too greasy and not too sweet, very tasty and easy to eat.

Title: How to make Banh beo chan with dried shrimp and minced meat
Ingredients:
Like this Banh Beo Chen, for example. This is the Banh Beo Chen that I imitated from the ones I ate during my trip at the end of last year. Banh Beo Chen is steamed in small, shallow bowls, and when eaten, you eat it right in the bowl, not taking the cake out onto a plate like I did. It's because my family only has 2 "bowls" that almost meet the standards for making Banh Beo Chen. They are actually 2 small, shallow plates that are more accurately used to hold dipping sauces. So after steaming the cake, I have to take it out of the bowl to pour another spoonful of flour in to continue steaming. Therefore, finishing the batch of mixed rice flour takes a lot of time and a lot of trouble.
But oh well, it's the weekend, it's okay to keep yourself busy in the kitchen, otherwise it's pointless lying around.
Banh beo also has many different versions depending on the region. Some places have to make scallion oil, stir-fry scallions in a pan of hot oil, and then add scallions to make it fragrant. Some places also have skin or fried pork rinds, which are also very fatty. More elaborate is making shrimp floss, also known as shrimp floss. Some places have minced meat, some places only have shrimp floss.
My choice is to keep it simple, not too greasy, and less greasy. So I made these banh beo with dried shrimp available at home. The shrimp was stir-fried with a little ground meat marinated with fragrant fish sauce and pepper. When eating, I sprinkled green onions on top of the cake and dipped it in the sauce. If I had taken the time to ‚Äúgrind‚Äù the shrimp a little more to make floss, the dish would have been more appealing. But for my family, this type of banh beo is more enjoyable to eat, not too greasy, with the sweet aroma of meat and dried shrimp.

Title: Let's make Garlic and Olive Oil Pizza
Ingredients:
I made this pizza with a thick crust, which was also my first time making this type of pizza. It's called pan pizza, but we don't have a pan at home, so I still shaped the pizza (round or square, depending on your preference) and placed it on a baking tray. And since the topping ingredients are just garlic and olive oil, I chose to make a thick crust so that I could eat my fill.
Today it rained heavily in the afternoon so the air cooled down, the weather was cooler so I felt like making pizza. A quick choice, no need to think too much about the weekend refrigerator, I felt very comfortable with this pizza. Pizza is crispy and delicious
Pan pizza recipe:
Ingredients: (makes 2 23cm pizza pans)
‚Äì 125g bread flour
‚Äì 160g plain flour
‚Äì 200ml warm water
‚Äì 1 tsp instant yeast
‚Äì 1/2 tsp honey
‚Äì 1 1/2 tsp olive oil

Title: Profiterole ‚Äì vanilla ice cream sandwich
Ingredients:
Because I had to bake the cake in paper cups, I had to peel it off the paper cups and it had these parallel lines. I still crave more. I really hope that if you try making the choux pastry using the recipe below, you will give me some feedback on the dough after mixing all the ingredients so that I can make sure again that I did not write the recipe wrong when making it.
Ingredient:
‚Äì 65g all-purpose flour
‚Äì 1/2 tsp white sugar
‚Äì 1/4 tsp salt
‚Äì 57g unsalted butter
‚Äì 120ml water
‚Äì 2 large eggs, beaten
‚Äì 1 egg + 1/8 tsp salt to make a mixture to brush on the cake surface
--------------------------------------------------
Title: How to make zucchini quiche
Ingredients:
My quiche was quite thin because I only made half of the recipe and the tart pan was too big for the amount of ingredients. If I made enough, the quiche would be thicker, but remember to invite a few friends over to eat with me, because the quiche needs to be eaten while it's still warm, it won't be as delicious when it cools down, and 1 person can only eat 2 thin slices like above (enough to be full and enough to eat more without feeling delicious).
Ingredients: (4-5 people)
‚Äì 4 eggs, stir with chopsticks until blended
‚Äì 3 cups of sliced zucchini (just slice the zucchini and put it in the measuring cup, until it reaches the 3 cups line)
‚Äì 1/2 cup onion, chopped
‚Äì 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
‚Äì 1 cup all-purpose flour
‚Äì 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
‚Äì 1/2 tsp salt

Title: Lamington ‚Äì chocolate and coconut covered cake
Ingredients:
I reduced the sugar in the cake, but when I ate it with the icing, it was still too sweet. The cake was fragrant, the dried coconut coating on the outside also made the cake more attractive, but it was too sweet for my family's taste. I don't know if I will ever make this cake again. Oh my, it's truly an Australian-style sweet cake.

Title: Chestnut candy
Ingredients:
‚Äì Boil the chestnuts, then peel off the skin, pound/grind the kernel or put the kernel into a blender. (Boiled chestnuts are often moist and difficult to blend with a blender. Therefore, let the chestnuts cool and dry before blending. If possible, roast the chestnuts instead of boiling them, which will make them drier and easier to blend.)
‚Äì Mix all remaining ingredients with chestnut flour.
‚Äì The way you shape the candy is up to you. You can use cute little candy molds to shape it, or simply like what we do at home, just roll it into a ball and wrap it in a plastic bag.
This candy should be kept in the refrigerator for preservation, it is still delicious when eaten cold.

‚Äì 8.75g (2 tsp) shortening
‚Äì 11.25g (2 1/2 tsp) sugar
(Why are there such odd numbers? Because I calculated from the original recipe's percentage. My family made 500g of flour to make 3 cakes about 30cm long, enough for 3 breakfasts. If we made more, we were afraid the cakes would spoil if left for too long, so we only dared to make them with 500g of flour).

‚Äì 2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour
‚Äì 70g white sugar
‚Äì 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
‚Äì 1/4 tsp salt

‚Äì 15g sugar
‚Äì 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder

--------------------------------------------------
Title: Salty donuts
Ingredients:
* Pie crust: (about 10-12 pieces)
‚Äì 330g glutinous rice flour + 70g rice flour + about 1/3 tsp salt
(mix the flour in the ratio: 80-85% sticky rice flour + 20-15% non-glutinous rice flour, from there change the total amount of flour depending on how many cakes you want to make)
‚Äì Slowly add warm water to the flour, mix the flour until the dough forms a mass, is slightly sticky, and comes off the bowl, with no more flour sticking to the sides of the bowl.
* Meat filling: this time the filling I made includes:
‚Äì Minced pork, about 200g
‚Äì Vermicelli: 100g, soak until soft, cut into small pieces.
‚Äì Wood ear, soak until soft, chop finely
‚Äì Carrot, 1, shredded and chopped.
‚Äì Finely chopped shallots.
‚Äì Marinate all ingredients with fish sauce, spices and ground pepper. Squeeze well.
Making the cake is not complicated. Flatten a ball of dough on the palm of your hand, then put the filling in the middle and shape it into a ball. Fry it in hot oil over medium heat until the cake is cooked, when the crust is golden brown. Do not fry it over high heat, the crust will burn quickly and the filling will not be cooked. When making the cake, those with big hands will have an easier time. My hands are a bit small so that day I had a hard time making the cake to get the size I see.
When eating, mix the sweet and sour dipping sauce, including fish sauce, sugar, water, vinegar and a little chili sauce. Adjust to taste.

Title: Delicious Soft Chocolate Cookies ‚Äì Chocolate Crinkles

‚Äì 2tsp vanilla
‚Äì 1/4 tsp salt
‚Äì 1/2 tsp baking powder
‚Äì Icing sugar to coat the chocolate
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Choux.. The first cream puff
Ingredients:
‚Äì Crust:
+ 240ml water
+ 125g flour
+ 100g unsalted butter
+ 4 eggs
+ 1 pinch of salt
‚Äì How to make the shell:
+ Put water, butter, salt in a pot (non-stick) and heat until boiling.
+ When the water boils, add the flour, stir quickly and you will see the mixture thicken into a mass that does not stick to the pot.
+ Turn off the stove, let it cool for a few minutes. Crack in each egg and beat well to create a smooth, glossy mixture.
+ Heat the pot at 220 degrees Celsius.
+ Put the mixture into a piping bag and squeeze it into any shape you want (the classic type is round and long, or heart-shaped, hehe) on a baking tray lined with baking paper, leaving each cake a little spaced apart because the cake is still expanding. Or you can use a spoon to scoop it into round shapes. This time I made round cakes, long cakes, and 2 heart-shaped cakes üòõ
+ Bake for 25 ‚Äì 30 minutes or until the cake turns slightly golden brown. Remove and let cool.
‚Äì Cream filling:
+ 300ml fresh milk.
+ 40g sugar
+ 3 egg yolks
+ 50g flour
+ 1 pinch of salt
+ 1 pinch vanilla
=> Put all the above ingredients in a pot, stir well, simmer while stirring continuously to get a soft sticky mixture. After a while, the filling will be cooked, remove and let cool.
When the cake crust cools, I use a sharp knife to cut across (without cutting) the body of the cake and then spread the cream inside. The cake is soft, fragrant, the cream is moderately sweet and rich, very delicious to eat.
With the amount of cream like that, I always use more than enough for the number of cake shells, although the cream is just enough for 1 cake. For those who eat a lot of cream, it will probably run out very quickly.

--------------------------------------------------
Title: Green tea cake
Ingredients:
‚Äì 140g all-purpose flour
‚Äì 85g butter, leave at room temperature to soften

‚Äì 1tsp salt

‚Äì 140g butter, cut into small pieces, leave at room temperature to soften
‚Äì 3 egg yolks
‚Äì 2 tablespoons green tea powder
‚Äì 70g powdered sugar (instead of 85g, I find using less sugar is less sweet so the tea flavor will be stronger and more fragrant)
‚Äì White sugar to cover the cake (I use very little to reduce sweetness)
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Walnut quince yogurt cake
Ingredients:
We still have a lot of quince at home, the water has long since been used up, but there is a lot of fruit pulp for baking, probably enough to make 6 or 7 batches of cakes. The other day I made muffins with quince and they said they tasted better than they looked. Today I used the same recipe to make this cake, but with some changes, both to create a new feeling when eating and to add more nutrition to the cake.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Pizza bread
Ingredients:
You may be in the same situation as me. Sometimes when I make pizza, I end up making extra toppings, including homemade tomato sauce and other vegetables and meats. When I have some left over, I don‚Äôt like having to keep it in the fridge, and I also feel embarrassed if I have to mix up another batch of pizza dough. But using sandwich bread is easy and convenient. Sandwich bread is one of the foods that is always available in my kitchen, especially when living in NZ, sandwich bread has become a staple food more than rice.
What's more, when you use bread as a pizza base, you have a wide variety of bread options, including rye, whole wheat, and multigrain breads. These types of bread will add more nutrition to your pizza.
For example, today I chose whole grain bread, the whole family liked it after baking and it was very quick and delicious. When making this type of bread pizza, children can also do it, they will be very excited to complete each small cake by themselves.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Learn about air fryer
Ingredients:
If you want to reheat food, the most convenient and fastest way is to use a microwave. But the disadvantage of a microwave is that it only heats but does not make it crispy, so foods with crispy crusts that are microwaved, even if it only takes 1-2 minutes to reheat, will become soft, chewy, and lose all their deliciousness. Therefore, for dishes that need to be crispy, you can use this air fryer to reheat the food while still maintaining the crispiness, the dish will be "almost" as delicious as the original.

Title: Common problems with cookies
Ingredients:
We always have a variety of cookies in our house. Whenever the cookie jar is empty, I am happy to make another batch. Cookies are the quickest way to fill a room with the delicious aroma of cookies.
My husband and kids are so happy because thanks to me, we get to enjoy so many different delicious cookie flavors.
I always advise new bakers to experiment with cookies first, for many reasons.
Even though it's that simple, sometimes batches of cookies still fail and "just don't work", something is clearly wrong.
Many times, just because we are careless and weigh the wrong ingredients, it can lead to problems, but we are so careless that we don't realize that we are careless, and we are sure that we weighed correctly, the temperature is also correct, so why is the cake like that???
Today I will share a summary of common problems with cookies and my experience in handling them, after a long time of baking.
The same problem can have many causes. Therefore, you can refer to the list of problems below to find a solution for yourself.
I wish you all a lot of fun baking and making more and more delicious and fragrant cakes. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to comment or message me on Facebook.

Title: Basic tools in baking
Ingredients:
That was what inspired Linh to try baking. At first, Linh was confused and full of questions, and had to read a lot before she could start baking. And now, after many years of baking at home, Linh wants to share some of her experiences in preparing baking tools with those who share the same inspiration and interest, to avoid the unnecessary waste and expense that she encountered when she first started the stage of wanting to try everything.
Linh said that because before she started, Linh also thought that only ‚Äúrich people‚Äù could pursue the hobby of baking. But the reality is not like that. Linh is not from a rich family, if not to say that life is still very difficult and the whole family always just barely makes ends meet. However, Linh still finds joy in baking. You just need to have passion!
Linh started her hobby of baking when she was a student, with little money, all the money she earned from part-time jobs was saved for baking and shared with other expenses. After finishing school and working to earn money, she also had to share her income with rent, children and other expenses in life. Therefore, in baking, Linh advocates efficiency, thrift, and not wasting anything. There are many types of cakes with different levels of ease and difficulty, there are "cheap" cakes because they do not require many expensive and high-quality ingredients. Therefore, if your conditions are still difficult and do not allow you to make high-quality cakes, there are still many types of cakes suitable for you to make.
The items that Linh lists below, along with the minimum quantity and most common sizes, are intended to help you have a comfortable baking experience, but not too wasteful and expensive in the beginning. Rest assured that if you pursue baking, your kitchen will gradually be filled with many separate items, quite different from those regular cooking utensils. But don't be in a hurry, just collect them one by one as you progress through your baking journey.
The basic tools needed for baking are as follows:
To choose the right oven, you can refer to the article on how to choose an oven.
There are many different types of cake molds, you can refer to the article about types of cake molds.
To start making cakes, Linh recommends that you prepare some of the most popular molds as follows:
1 round mold: can remove the base (spring form), or 1 round mold with removable base made in Vietnam is also enough for you to make cakes. Mold size: diameter 20-23cm or 18‚Äù ‚Äì 19‚Äù, is the mold size commonly used in many cake recipes.
1 square mold: 20x20cm, removable base is more convenient.
1 tart pan: round, wavy for beauty, removable bottom is better, helps you easily remove the whole cake from the pan.
1 muffin pan: 12 holes for making muffins or cupcakes.
Several flat baking trays: for making cookies, rolls, bread, etc. When you buy an oven, there is usually a tray already in it, so in theory you can use it as a baking tray. However, because this tray is always black, when you use it to bake cakes, especially small cakes such as cookies, cream puffs, small breads, etc., the bottom of the cake is often burnt and dark in color, while the top may not be cooked, because the black tray absorbs heat very strongly. Therefore, Linh almost never uses this tray, unless it is used to bake meat or fish.
1 loaf pan: used in many types of cakes.
1 oven thermometer: to check the oven temperature, make sure the oven reaches the required temperature to bake the cake, then we put the cake in the oven. Each oven has its own time needed to reach the required temperature in the recipe, many times we do not know after 10 minutes, 15 or 20 minutes the oven will reach 180 degrees Celsius, the oven thermometer will help us know this.
2 oven mitts: you definitely don't want to burn your hands, so make sure you choose a thick, sturdy pair.
Several wooden, silicone, plastic or rubber spatulas. Choose soft, easy-to-use spatulas. Silicone spatulas are now quite cheap and very convenient and do not deform due to heat.
A few large mixing bowls will help you make the most of your baking time. Stainless steel bowls are durable and attractive. You can also choose plastic bowls.
1 fine mesh sieve helps you sift flour, cocoa powder, green tea powder, etc. The sifting step is simple but very important, helping you make more successful cakes.
A cake knife is of course used to cut cakes.
Icing knife, frosting knife: of course most bakers love to experiment with cake decorating, so a small icing knife is suitable for you in your first practice. Linh has been decorating cakes for many years and still loves these cute little spatulas more than the big ones üòõ
Baking paper. Good paper can be used many times.
A few hand whisks. These are great for mixing dough, beating eggs, and even sifting flour. They come in different sizes and thicknesses, so you should have a few handy.
1 set of basic piping tips and piping bags, ready to simply decorate your cakes.
1 rolling pin ‚Äì used to roll dough for cookies, bread, fondant decorations, etc‚Ä¶
Some cookie cutters, help you create beautiful cookies.
1 small scale, maximum about 2kg is enough, the smaller the weight division the better. Small electronic scales are now very cheap, equivalent to a plate scale, very convenient to use.
1 international standard measuring cup, divided into 1 cup, 2 cups‚Ä¶ or ml, oz.
1 set of measuring spoons from large to small, divided into the correct amount of 1 table spoon, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 teaspoon. Many small ingredients are measured with measuring spoons.
1 set of measuring cups. Most foreign cake recipes use Cups as the measuring unit, so with this tool, you don't have to bother converting measurements.
A small set of food coloring including basic colors, so you can always be ready to decorate your cakes.
1 medium-sized turntable, you can choose the plastic or glass type, the heavier the turntable, the easier and more durable it is to use. The turntable will help you divide the cake layers evenly and beautifully, and cover the cake quickly and easily.
That‚Äôs it for now, for a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù completely different from cooking, there are already many items mentioned. And there are many more extremely interesting baking items waiting for you to discover on your baking journey at home.
Happy Baking everyone üôÇ

Title: Experience in choosing and using a mixer
Ingredients:
Hand mixers usually come with 3 beaters as I mentioned above. And hand mixers will not come with a mixing bowl. Although there are 3 types of beaters, because hand mixers usually have a lower capacity than stand mixers, you almost cannot use the bread dough beaters, but only use the other 2 ends.
Hand mixer is compact, suitable for small kitchens, and suitable for those who occasionally bake, and do not bake bread, if you bake bread, you will have to knead it by hand. Hand mixer is therefore also much cheaper. Because it is compact, you can put it away neatly after baking. With just a hand mixer, you can make many types of bread.
Stand mixer is a tabletop mixer. As its name suggests, it needs to be placed on the kitchen counter, and it is much larger than a handheld mixer, so if you want to use it, you have to set aside a place for it. When you buy it, the machine always has a mixing bowl placed on the base of the machine. When you use it, you just need to press the button and the beater will automatically rotate around the mixing bowl. Some types of stand mixers also rotate the mixing bowl. The mixing bowl of a stand mixer can be made of plastic, glass, or stainless steel, these are the 3 most common materials commonly found in stand mixers.
Stand mixers are usually more powerful than hand mixers, so they are more powerful, most of them are powerful enough to knead bread dough. Stand mixers therefore come in many levels of ‚Äúbigness‚Äù, depending on the capacity of the mixing bowl. If you make a lot of bread, each time you make a large quantity, then you should choose a stand mixer with a larger mixing bowl capacity and a more powerful machine.
The most convenient thing about a stand mixer is that you can bake more easily, without having to use your hands to hold the mixer, and most importantly, you can make more types of bread comfortably.
In terms of price, hand mixer is always significantly cheaper than stand mixer. However, using stand mixer is much easier, especially for those who are new to baking and are not familiar with the operations, holding a hand mixer will feel awkward and difficult to control. As for those who are proficient in baking, using a hand mixer is not difficult.
I have been baking for more than ten years. There was a time when I only had a weak hand mixer, but I was still satisfied because I could make many types of bread with it. Every time I make bread, I will knead the dough by hand, no problem, consider it a little exercise for my arm muscles?
But usually my kitchen always has both types of dough mixers, because I bake a lot. Since having children, I make bread more than cakes, because I make bread for the whole family for breakfast, main meals, and snacks. I don't have enough time and energy to knead so many batches of dough by hand, so I have to have an assistant, a stand mixer, to knead for me.
I still use it in combination with a hand mixer very often, that is when I need to beat or mix a few ingredients, using a hand mixer is very convenient, fast, and easy to clean. Sometimes I need to beat exactly 1 egg white, for example, I can't use a big stand mixer, but I only need 1 beater that fits in a cup to beat the egg white.
In short, I think that if you have the conditions and bake regularly, having both mixers will help you bake more conveniently and easily.
So if you don't have a mixer yet and are thinking about buying one, first decide whether to buy a stand mixer or a hand mixer.
When you first start baking, Linh advises you not to buy a mixer that is too fancy and expensive right away. (Of course, if money is not a big issue for you, then you can go ahead and buy whatever type you like.)
Why? That‚Äôs because you may not know how long you will be passionate about baking. There are people who like baking at first, but then due to lack of time, busy and tiring work, because they try a lot but still fail, they get discouraged, because after making cakes they realize they don‚Äôt like cakes very much,‚Ä¶ and then they won‚Äôt make cakes often anymore, so buying an expensive mixer and not using it much will be a waste.
Linh's advice for a mixer with a reasonable price and very good quality for initial use is a Philips mixer, with a capacity of 350W or more. You can choose a hand mixer or a stand mixer of this brand. In addition, the Blue Stone hand mixer is also quite good, the capacity is large enough, and the machine is quite durable. Linh has used both of these brands.
For those who bake regularly and want to upgrade to a more professional machine, the most popular choice is the KitchenAid mixer, Artisan line. With a Kitchen Aid machine, you can always be assured of the durability and convenience of the machine. It can be said that, up to this point, Kitchen Aid is still the leading prestigious brand in the line of high-end dough mixers serving the level of baking at home or baking in a small bakery, not yet mass-produced in large quantities. In addition to this brand, you can refer to the machine lines of the Kenwood or Cuisinart brands. Currently, Linh's bakery uses a KitchenAid Pro line, the largest capacity type, while at home, Linh uses a Cuisinart machine, and has always been satisfied.
Now, buying a KitchenAid machine in Vietnam is much easier than when I first started baking. You just need to google "buy KitchenAid machine" and you will find websites and shops in Vietnam that sell KitchenAid mixers. The machines sold in Vietnam have the advantage of using 220V voltage, so you don't need to worry about voltage and transformers. Why do I talk about KitchenAid machines in particular and not other machines? Because in the community of people who love baking and cooking in Vietnam, people still prefer KitchenAid machines over other brands of mixers.
If you don't buy in Vietnam but prefer to buy from Amazon, for example, you can now buy easily with today's fast and convenient global shipping service.
I mentioned refurbished / renewed machines because I mentioned buying from Amazon above. There are machines that have minor defects from the manufacturer or during transportation, when they reach the buyer, they are returned and repaired and resold on the market. These machines are not considered new, so they are labeled refurbished / renewed and are always sold at a cheaper price than brand new machines. The nature of these machines is all new because they have not been used, but retailers cannot sell them at the same price as new machines.
I will tell you that all the KitchenAid machines that I have bought are refurbished, I have saved a lot of money by buying refurbished products. However, they are not always available because machines do not have many faults, they only happen occasionally. My refurbished machines have been running smoothly for over a decade now.
Mixer is an indispensable tool in baking, so Linh hopes you will choose an effective mixer to experience the diverse and interesting world of baking.

Title: How to make jackfruit seeds with mulberry
Ingredients:
Braised jackfruit seeds eaten with yogurt are always great. With the mulberry color, when mixed well, my yogurt bowl looks exactly like purple sticky rice yogurt üòÄ
Because I used strawberry jam, there were many small pieces of strawberry stuck around the jelly seeds, the color was very rich, I mixed a glass of strawberry juice with jelly seeds and basil seeds to cool down. Saigon is extremely hot these days and I always feel thirsty in hot weather like this.
Please share your delicious dishes made from jackfruit seeds ^^

Title: 9 delicious pancakes that don't require an oven
Ingredients:
We will eat this with butter and syrup, or fruit jam. The most famous syrup often used with pancakes is maple syrup.
This pancake is not basic anymore. Pumpkin pancake is extremely flavorful, fragrant and attractive. The batter is mixed with pureed pumpkin and some spices such as cinnamon powder, ginger powder, nutmeg powder, clove powder, so you know how special the cake will taste.
To make this pancake, you will also need a list of ingredients. For those of you who often bake, most of them are available in the kitchen. Peanut butter combined with chocolate is just delicious.
This pancake has peanut butter and chocolate, both of which are sweet enough to be eaten with syrup. Maybe a little bit of sour fruit jam to make the cake more appealing.
The pancakes are soft, very fragrant, not too sweet, and delicious with strawberry sauce. The pancakes are best eaten warm. The pink part is Linh's homemade strawberry sauce, which goes very well with this pancake and is delicious.
Do you like Japanese green tea flavor? Pancake also has green tea flavor. My family has a 6-year-old kid who loves green tea flavor, so I sometimes make green tea flavor.
The cake is soft, fragrant, and very easy to eat. Linh's family often eats this type of pancake with honey.
Pineapple is one of Linh‚Äôs favorite fruits, so I also really like cakes with fresh pineapple. Pineapple pancake with fresh pineapple slices in the middle makes the cake look like it‚Äôs blooming üòÄ
Do you know that Doraemon's donuts are actually pancakes? That's right. Linh knows that many children love this robot cat character and the cartoon Doraemon, my kids do too, so if mom goes into the kitchen to make Doraemon donuts, the kids will love it. The only problem is that Doraemon donuts are actually very sweet, especially the red bean filling, when making them, I often have to reduce the sugar to reduce the sweetness quite a bit compared to the "original".
You can make this kind of pancake for the whole family to have breakfast, it is both delicious and attractive. Linh knows that sausage is not a good food, but from adults to children, most people like sausage. Linh often limits buying foods that are not really good for health, so she only occasionally feeds the whole family sausage üòÄ
Both use sweet corn but the two pancake recipes are completely different, so they also produce two different flavors. Try them out.
Hope you have delicious cakes. So the pan in your kitchen has another great function.

Title: 14 ways to make Sponge cake/Gato for birthday cake decoration
Ingredients:
With this recipe, you can easily bake it in a rice cooker or use a conventional oven.
Add a little cream and some fruit and you have an attractive cake. It is not necessary to pipe a lot of cream on the cake, right?
Hong Kong sponge cake is a little more complicated than basic sponge cake, but still not difficult. The cake uses the method of separating the egg whites and yolks, only beating the egg whites. Linh has made this cake many times, to be honest, if the steps are all correct (meaning: the oven temperature is correct, the egg whites are beaten to the right degree, not too stiff, the dough is mixed well without any lumps, the baking time is sufficient), then the cake will definitely be cooked beautifully, fragrant, no longer have the egg smell and will not expand too much to the point of cracking the surface and then collapsing.
Sometimes Linh falls into an unexpected situation where she needs to make a cake but lacks a lot of ingredients and tools to do it. Therefore, Linh often chooses the fastest solution which is to bake a simple, easy-to-use sponge cake (meaning it doesn‚Äôt require many ingredients and tools). Then, go to the supermarket and buy a box of whipping cream and some fruit to quickly ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a delicious cake.
Linh often chooses the sponge cake roll recipe to make birthday cake base, especially when needing to cut and create special shapes for the cake.
After baking, instead of rolling it up, we will leave the cake flat. From this cake, you can cut the cake into any shape you like. You can make small cakes for 1 person, cut into hearts, circles, squares, cut numbers, cut out cartoon characters, in general, customize it according to your skill.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Distinguishing 12 types of baking flour
Ingredients:
Should we buy imported flour? According to Linh, it is not really necessary to buy foreign flour brands that are 3-4, even 5 times more expensive than domestic flour. In Vietnam, there are many flour manufacturing and processing factories, both producing for domestic demand and exporting to other countries, so domestic flour also ensures technical and quality standards and parameters.
First, remember that one of the basic distinctions between flours is the gluten content. Different gluten contents will produce different flour products.
Gluten content can also be called Protein content, because protein in wheat flour is the substance that makes up gluten.
Common types of flour:
All purpose flour is a multi-purpose flour, as its name suggests, with a gluten content of about 9.5% - 11.5%. This is the most popular type of flour and is often used when making "homegrown" cakes. This type of flour is widely used in many cake recipes, even in some types of sweet bread, for the convenience of the baker. As for professional bakeries, all-purpose flour is often not used, but bakers will definitely choose specialized flours for each type of cake, depending on the gluten content requirements of the cake.
This type of flour is also called Plain Flour. In Vietnam, for many years ago until now, many bakers still call all-purpose flour number 8 flour.
Cake Flour is a type of flour with a very low gluten content, about 7.5%-8.5%, very light and smooth flour, white in color. Cake flour is used to make cakes with a spongy, soft, light texture such as chiffon cake, angel food cake, Japanese cotton cheesecake, Hong Kong cake, roll cake, etc. In general, for cakes, if you want the cake to be soft and light, you should use cake flour.
You can even make cookies with cake flour very well.
Bread flour is a type of flour with a high gluten content of 11.5%-13%, used to make bread. Gluten will interact with yeast to develop and create a chewy and firm texture for the bread. In Vietnam for many years, home bakers have been used to calling bread flour Cai Can flour or flour number 11.
A relative of this bread flour is High-gluten flour, a type of flour used to make hard, crispy breads, such as pizza or bagels.
Self-rising flour is a type of flour that already has baking powder and sometimes salt mixed in. The advantage of this type of flour is that the baking powder is mixed very well with the flour, but its application is more limited for two reasons: first, each type of cake requires a different amount of baking powder. Second, baking powder will lose its effectiveness over time, so it can affect the quality of the cake (the cake will not rise).
Linh rarely uses this type of flour. Linh always has the 3 types of flour above available in her kitchen to use for different baking purposes. However, if you have a very good cake recipe that requires self-rising flour, you can mix this type of flour yourself with the following ratio:
1 cup self-rising flour = 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp salt
Pastry flour is a low gluten flour, but still higher than cake flour, about 9%. The flour is creamy white in color, suitable for making pie crusts, tarts, cookies, biscuits and muffins.
There are also other types of flour other than wheat flour that are also often needed when making Western cakes.
In Vietnamese, it is commonly called corn flour or cornstarch, but corn flour is also divided into two basic types:
‚Äì White cornstarch (cornflour, cornstarch): is a white, smooth and very light flour, made from the white core of corn kernels. In cooking, cornstarch also acts as a thickener when making soups or sauces.
‚Äì Yellow cornmeal (cornmeal, or sometimes called Polenta): is flour ground from whole dry corn kernels
There are also many other names for flours that are difficult to understand if translated into Vietnamese because Vietnamese people are not familiar with these grains. Therefore, I will just go through the names so that everyone has a little idea about the flours from other grains used to make cakes.
Flour made from finely ground whole wheat kernels is also known as whole wheat flour.
Flour is made from the outer shell of the wheat kernel.
Flour made from rye grains. There are varieties such as light rye, medium rye, dark rye, whole rye flour, rye meal, rye blend.
Flour made from oat grains. Common oat products are rolled oats and oat bran.
Buckwheat flour, often used to make pancakes or crepes. (The famous Japanese soba noodles are made from buckwheat flour). In Vietnam, this type of buckwheat grain is called triangular buckwheat.
Also known as Semolina, this flour is made from durum grain (don't know what the Vietnamese name is). Spaghetti and dry pasta are made from this flour. In baking, this flour is used to make Italian specialty breads.
Above is how to distinguish the types of flour we most commonly encounter in daily cooking and baking. Linh hopes that this article helps you get a lot of useful information. Happy Baking ^^

Title: Distinguishing the 10 most popular types of cheese
Ingredients:
Cheese, in English called Cheese, is a product that contains a lot of protein and fat from milk, usually cow's, goat's, and sheep's milk. Cheese originated in the West, Vietnamese people still call cheese by the common name of Pho-mat or Pho-mai (perhaps due to the mispronunciation of the French word "fromage" - meaning cheese). There are hundreds of different types of cheese in the world used in Western dishes. Just take Italian dishes, without cheese there would be no such thing as Italian cuisine. The two most famous Italian dishes in the world, pasta and pizza, would not exist without cheese. There is a saying, roughly translated, if the French cook with water and wine, the Italians cook pasta with water and cheese.
People have been making cheese from animal milk since 4000 years ago. There are types of cheese that are used specifically for cooking, types that are used specifically for baking, and types that can be used for both baking and cooking. There are hard cheeses and soft cheeses. Cheese is sold in large blocks, small blocks in bags, boxes, sliced, or shredded. In this article, I will review the most commonly used types of cheese that food lovers should know.
Parmesan is the short name for Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. This is the most typical cheese in Pasta. Parmesan is a hard cheese, made from cow's milk and takes at least 1 year, usually 2 to 3 years to mature.
Parmesan can be eaten raw or cooked in dishes. When eating, parmesan is usually grated, shredded, sliced or cut into small pieces. You should buy whole blocks of Parmesan and grate it when you want to use it. This type is tastier and retains the cheese flavor better than buying the pre-grated type.
Because parmesan has a strong, slightly bitter taste, it is often used to add flavor to dishes, used in small to moderate amounts. Parmesan is used to sprinkle on top of pasta dishes, sprinkle on salads, add to risotto, mixed with breadcrumbs to sprinkle on the famous dish maccaroni and cheese, or as a coating for fried breaded dishes.
Here are some dishes using Parmesan you can refer to:
Cheddar is a hard, pale yellow or ivory-white cheese, originating from the village of Cheddar, Somerset, is the most popular cheese in the UK and is also the most consumed cheese in the world. The longer cheddar is aged, the sharper it becomes, the time for cheddar to reach "ripeness" is from 9 to 24 months. Sliced cheddar is often used in burgers, sandwiches, used in grilled dishes such as baked pasta or pizza, or casserole, risotto.
I often use cheddar for toasted bread for breakfast. When making pizza, I also often add slices of cheddar combined with Mozzarella to make the pizza more fragrant and rich in cheese flavor.
In addition, cheddar is also used in savory dishes such as cookies, savory tarts, savory muffins, etc. Just like Parmesan, you should buy large pieces of cheddar and then cut them according to your needs, so the cheddar will taste better.
Sharing with you some dishes Linh has made with Cheddar cheese:
Mozzarella is a cheese originating from Italy, also classified in the cream cheese group, made from water buffalo milk or cow's milk. In its fresh form, mozzarella is quite soft, ranging in color from white to yellow depending on the diet of the buffalo or cow from which the milk is taken. Traditionally, fresh mozzarella is made and eaten on the same day. Due to its high moisture content, fresh mozzarella can be stored in the refrigerator for about 1 week. Mozzarella that has been dried by reducing the water and has been cut into small pieces like today can be stored for up to 6 weeks. Mozzarella is an indispensable cheese in pizza, after baking, mozzarella will melt and form tough and sticky cheese strings.
I usually buy large blocks of mozzarella, and when I need to make something, I cut it as needed. Mozzarella is a soft and moist cheese, so it gets moldy very quickly. When you open the package and use a knife to cut it, bacteria can easily penetrate the surface of the cheese, so you shouldn't leave it for too long, and keep it in the chill room of the refrigerator. Remember to use clean hands and a clean knife when cutting mozzarella to extend the shelf life of the leftover cheese.
Pizza is never complete without mozzarella, remember that. Here Linh introduces some non-pizza dishes that use mozzarella that she has made.
Blue cheese is the name of the type of cheese that has blue, sometimes blue-gray or blue-green spots in the cheese. It is this blue component that creates the characteristic flavor. This type of cheese is made from cow, sheep or goat milk, blue cheese is just a general name for a series of blue cheeses with different names. This type of cheese is very suitable to eat with fruit, crackers (a type of crispy biscuit) or wine.
Blue cheese has a strong smell and a slightly unpleasant taste for those who are not used to it. It is also not a cheap or common cheese. In Vietnam, it is sold at a quite high price, and perhaps only very special Western dishes in 5-star hotels and restaurants use this type. Linh has made dishes with blue cheese but only dared to use the lightest tasting blue cheese.
Sharing with you two dishes Linh made with blue cheese.
Emmental is the name of a type of cheese made from cow's milk originating from Switzerland. The minimum aging time for this cheese is 4 months. This cheese is light yellow in color, the taste is also very easy to eat, even has a slightly sour taste, similar to the sour taste of fruit. This is not a hard cheese nor a soft one, it is a bit chewy, when cooked it melts easily, so it is often used to add flavor to soups.
Westerners often eat cheese with fresh fruit, and emmental is always a favorite choice of many people. Emmental is also produced into thin slices to eat with burgers or sandwiches. My family also often buys emmental cheese in square slices to eat with sandwiches.
Edam is the name of a Dutch cheese originating from the Edam region. This type of cheese has a characteristic spherical or cylindrical shape, light yellow in color and covered with a red rind. Edam is a type of cheese that is easy to preserve, difficult to spoil, the longer it is stored, the harder it becomes, so it is easily transported back and forth for trade between places, thus becoming the most famous and popular cheese during the 14th - 18th centuries.
This type of cheese also melts easily and is easy to slice thinly, so it is often used as a topping for sandwiches, burgers, and added to soups for flavor.
Gouda is another very popular cheese, a semi-hard to hard cheese, made from cow's milk, originating from the Netherlands. After aging, this cheese will change its flavor and texture. This cheese has a sharp, strong and sweet taste. This cheese can be shredded and sprinkled on salads. Westerners also use this cheese directly to drink with beer, orange juice, apple juice, white wine, red wine.
The 7 types of cheese above are easy to use and easy to find in supermarkets. Nowadays, you can also buy other types of cheese in Vietnam such as Swiss Cheese, Camembert, Feta, Roquefort, Ch√®vre, etc. The world of cheese is very diverse, the number of types of cheese Linh has the opportunity to use for cooking is still very small.
Cream cheese is a type of cheese that Vietnamese people often call cream cheese. This is a fresh, white, soft cheese with a light and slightly sweet cheese flavor. This is the main and very familiar ingredient for making cheesecake. Cream cheese can also be eaten "fresh" with bread, crackers, etc., or made into cake frosting. Some types of cakes must use cream cheese to be considered authentic, such as red velvet cake, carrot cake.
Cream cheese can be made at home, many people in Vietnam have tried it. Linh is always short of time, and compared to other types of cheese, cream cheese is cheaper, so every time she makes a cake, she buys cream cheese for speed and convenience.
Linh has made many different types of cheesecake that are delicious. And she also makes brownies with cream cheese that are also delicious. Below Linh lists some types, then you can find more on the blog.
Mascarpone is a soft, fresh cheese that is not really cheese, it is just a product created when an additive is added to the process of separating cream from milk. Mascarpone is soft, white, and fresh. To make tiramisu, mascarpone is indispensable to create an extremely soft and fragrant cream.
Mascarpone can be eaten straight with desserts, with fruit, made into no-bake cheesecakes, or added to soups when making creamy soups to add richness and aroma to the soup.
Mascarpone originated in Italy and created the famous Italian Tiramisu cake. Speaking of tiramisu, Linh will tell you a little about its cream. The classic Tiramisu has a very soft, smooth cream so the whole tiramisu cake can hardly stand on its own, especially when the cake is soaked in coffee liquor, so people often make Tiramisu in a cup and when you eat it, you need to see this cream layer melt. Tiramisu sold in Vietnam at cafes, bakeries, or made privately, often has gelatin added and does not use mascarpone, the cream is even hard and chewy, very thick.
Linh would like to introduce to you some variations of Tiramisu.
Ricotta is a cheese of Italian origin, made from the whey of cow or sheep's milk. During the process of separating the cream to make cheese, some of the whey is separated, and this whey is used to make ricotta. This cheese is soft, white, slightly sweet and very low in fat. Ricotta is popular in Italian desserts or as a topping for other desserts. Ricotta is also used in cheesecakes and many cookies. Pasta and pizza also have recipes using ricotta.
Here are some dishes with ricotta that Linh has made to share with you.
I will temporarily review 10 types of cheese that I have used above. In a world of hundreds of types of cheese, in a country that does not produce or cook cheese dishes like Vietnam, it is very difficult to have experience with them, unless you travel, live, study, work in Western countries or eat Western food. If you have any opportunity, do not hesitate to try and explore.

But you can make the filling sour, by using sour fruits such as lemon, raspberry, blackberry, cranberry. The sourness of these fruits This will soften the sweetness of the macarons.
This is a very easy to make cookie, delicious, loved by both the elderly and children, and is very suitable for daily eating, as a gift and as a cake to entertain guests during Tet. The cake is crispy, spongy, fragrant with butter, if you like you can add almonds on top of the cake to make the cake more delicious and attractive.
I often make three flavors of cat tongue cookies like the picture above: vanilla cat tongue, chocolate cat tongue, green tea cat tongue. They are very beautiful to put in a box or in a tied bag as a gift.
This is one of my family's favorite cookies. It takes a long time to make a box, but it's gone in a flash. The cookies use only egg whites. Just a little egg white can make a lot of thin, crispy cookies. If you're picky, you can roll them into tubes. I used to roll them when I had free time, but now I hardly have time to roll them anymore and just want to finish the batch as quickly as possible. You can also make Chocolate Rolled Almonds, which are also delicious.
Angle food cake is a type of cake originating from America and has been very popular since the 19th century. Indeed, the white, light and soft cake feels very "angelic". The cake uses only egg whites to create fluffiness for the cake, and they are often baked in tube molds. This cake is often served with fresh cream and slightly sour fruits, becoming a very popular cake in the West.
Pavlova is a type of cake that appeared in the 1920s and is famous to this day and is considered one of the traditional cakes of Australia and New Zealand. The cake is made entirely from egg whites, the cake has a crispy crust on the outside and a soft marshmallow layer on the inside. The cake is often served with whipped cream and fruit, and it is best to choose sour fruits to balance the sweetness of the cake. If you want to enjoy the taste of chocolate, then here is a chocolate pavlova cake for you to try.
Souffle is also a type of cake that helps you take advantage of leftover egg whites to make an easy-to-eat and delicious cake, with a sweet and sour taste of fresh passion fruit. Souffl√© is often "rumored" to be difficult to make, but whether it is really difficult or not, you just have to try it to know, who knows, you might be able to make it successfully from the first time üòâ This low-fat chocolate souffl√© is also worth a try.
The sour lemon tart served with baked merigue cream is also a great combination. This is also a "classic" cake, in cooking competitions it is often used as a "topic" for chefs to try their hand at.
This type of cookie also uses only egg whites, but my family rarely makes it because it is a bit too sweet for our taste, even though I have reduced the sugar. This cookie uses chestnuts, sunflower seeds and oats, so in addition to being sweet, this is also a type of cookie with a lot of nutrition.
If you are bored with cakes, you can make candy. This candy is not like regular candy, but because I don‚Äôt know what to call it, I will temporarily call it candy, hehe. Almonds made this way are very delicious and attractive. And of course, this dish will help you use up a little bit of egg whites üòõ

Title: Types of vegetable cutting ‚Äì knife skills
Ingredients:
Each dish has its own way of cutting vegetables that suits the way we intend to cook it, and the dish itself. This is true not only for vegetables but also for meat, fish, etc.
A simple example is cutting onions. If you are making a stir-fry with onions, we usually cut the onions along the onion into wide, semi-circular pieces. If you are making a pizza sauce, we need to cut the onions very small and finely. And to make shredded chicken, to avoid the onion flavor being too strong and spicy, we need to cut the onions into very thin slices.
Cutting vegetables properly is not only a matter of how we cut them (into what shape), but equally important is that we need to cut them evenly. Cutting ingredients into even pieces helps them cook evenly, without some being crushed or raw, helps you control the cooking time more precisely, and the dish itself looks more beautiful when presented than with large and small pieces, and of course the dish will look more professional, hehe.
The names of the vegetable cutting styles that I have compiled below are mostly of French origin. In Western cuisine and in culinary academia, the names of dishes and cooking techniques use French words a lot. (Is that why the French are always proud that French cuisine is the quintessence of the world? :P). All chefs who have gone through school know these terms, and many food bloggers and culinary websites around the world also use these terms quite often.
The applications of this type of cutting are also very diverse. You can use it to make salads, spring rolls, stir-fried dishes...
The application of this type of cutting is to cook soups, make fried rice, make salads, fried balls, or to decorate the main dish.
With this style, we can cook soup, porridge, ...
As shown in the photo above, zucchini is shredded when I make Thai zucchini salad. When I cook zucchini soup, I also shred it like this. It's delicious when cooked with dried shrimp or clams üòÄ
There are other ways to cut vegetables, but these are the ones we do most often in cooking. Hopefully you will learn more interesting things after reading this article, just like Linh when writing it still finds herself thinking about many interesting things üòÄ
Wish you all a happy January ^^

Title: How to make chocolate raisins and pumpkin seeds
Ingredients:
When choosing to buy chocolate as an ingredient for baking, we can choose chocolate with different levels of sweetness depending on our preferences and purposes. I don't like eating milk chocolate or sweet chocolate, so I usually choose to buy chocolate with 65% or more, when the sweetness is very moderate. I once made heart-shaped chocolate for Valentine's Day, now that Tet is almost here, I have pumpkin seeds and raisins in the house, so I'm inspired to make chocolate to enjoy during the Tet holidays. Chocolate truffle is also a perfect choice for something special to treat guests during Tet, although this chocolate truffle has been "famous" for several years now. If you want something more unique, you can try making green tea truffle, but this type is too sweet for me so I rarely make it.
Of course, in addition to pumpkin seeds and raisins, you can use any kind of nuts or dried fruit you like to put in your chocolate, such as cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, dried apricots, cranberries, dried cherries... Please note that when melting chocolate, we should not use high heat, we can boil it in a double boiler for safety. Then we mix the nuts and dried fruits into the chocolate. I have seen many people ask why the chocolate is not solid, not smooth, when asked, I found out that those people added fresh milk or melted butter, so the chocolate can immediately become lumpy or then too liquid, the chocolate cannot solidify into pieces. Please note that you should not add other liquids to the chocolate, if you do so, we will not have hard chocolate bars.
Nowadays, there are many types of cute chocolate molds. If you make chocolate in those molds, children will definitely love it. Even adults like to look at cute molds, hehe. But without molds, we can still comfortably make great chocolate bars. You just need a mold, a baking tray, or anything similar, just line the bottom with baking paper, pour the chocolate on top, sprinkle nuts on top, and put it in the refrigerator. After a while, the chocolate will harden, we can take it out and cut it into any shape we want.
I wish you all the best in creating delicious chocolates with many flavors.

Title: How to make mixed mooncakes
Ingredients:
My filling this time includes:
‚Äì Mai Que Lo sausage, sliced, then cut into smaller pieces
‚Äì lotus seed jam, chopped
‚Äì pumpkin jam, chopped
‚Äì pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds... all roasted
‚Äì lemon leaves (about 10 leaves, lemon leaves are also picked from the lemon tree grown at home ^^), chopped very finely
‚Äì five spice powder: about 1 tbs
‚Äì soy sauce: about 2 tbs
‚Äì aromatic wine (you can use Japanese, Korean cooking wine or Mai Que Lo wine): 3 tbs
‚Äì grapefruit flower water: 1 tbsp
‚Äì Moon cake flour: 3 ‚Äì 5 tbs
Put all the ingredients in a pan, mix them together, then put them on the stove and cook for about 3-5 minutes, until the ingredients become even and stick together. You can test by pinching a little of the ingredients in your hand and squeezing to see if they stick together or fall apart.
Some notes when making mixed filling:
‚Äì If the filling is dry and loose, it will be difficult to form a round ball, and when you cut the cake, it will not look nice and the filling will fall out. Therefore, the filling needs to have good adhesion.
‚Äì The filling is sticky thanks to the moisture of the filling and the use of glutinous rice flour. Glutinous rice flour has the property of binding ingredients together. If you make a filling with fat, your filling will be stickier because the fat will also seep into the other ingredients when cooking, so you may not need to add too much glutinous rice flour. If you make a filling without fat, you need to use more glutinous rice flour and add more wine to make the filling stick together better.
‚Äì You can use salted eggs if you like.
‚Äì Shape the filling into balls, the weight depends on the size of the cake you want to make. You should shape the filling while it is still hot, it will stick better and be softer, easier to shape. To prevent your hands from sticking when shaping, you can rub cooking oil on both palms, this way you can grasp the filling easily.
Wish you have delicious batches of mixed moon cakes ^^
--------------------------------------------------
Title: How to make moon cake
Ingredients:
Above are two bowls of flour mixed with the same recipe, but the sugar water has different dark and light colors. The sugar water was cooked properly, left long enough, and had a dark color, so the flour was darker right after mixing (bowl on the left), which also helped the whole cake to have a darker color from the beginning. The bowl on the right used new sugar water, which is lighter in color.
How to make a cake:
‚Äì Roll the dough into a thin circle, with a diameter large enough to wrap the filling inside.
‚Äì Place the filling in the middle, gently wrap the outer shell of the filling. Use a thin layer of flour to coat the outer shell of the cake, called flour coating, to prevent the cake from sticking to the mold.
‚Äì Press the cake into the mold, take it out and put it on the baking tray. (The cake molds are very easy to use so I probably don't need to describe each step in detail :D)
For the egg part to brush the crust, I also tried a few different ways. Before making it this year, I also thought about the fact that many people have not been able to make a cake with a satisfactory color. The idea of brushing the egg kept going around in my head, and suddenly I used it once when I made bread. I used fresh milk, just fresh milk to brush the surface of the cake, and the color was very even and beautiful. So I tried using milk mixed into the egg mixture. The result was a cake with a very satisfactory color. I share it so that you can try this method and see how it goes.
* Egg recipe for brushing the surface of the cake:
‚Äì 1 egg yolk
‚Äì 1/2 egg white
‚Äì 1 tsp sweetened condensed milk dissolved in 2 tsp water
=> stir well so that the eggs mix with the ingredients and there are no more egg lumps left.
This is the cake tray after pouring the mold.
How to bake:
‚Äì Turn on the oven 20 minutes in advance, at 230 degrees Celsius. 2 heating element mode.
‚Äì Place the baking tray in the oven, in the middle position of the oven. Bake for 5 minutes, take the baking tray out and immediately spray water on the cake (use a spray bottle), spray both on the surface of the cake and the sides of the cake, until the water condenses into tiny drops on the tray. (Do not spray too little or too much, otherwise the cake will be soggy and the crust will be flaky).
‚Äì Wait a few minutes for the water to evaporate and the cake surface to dry again. Now take a soft brush dipped in egg and brush it on the surface and sides of the cake. Be careful not to leave excess egg on the patterns, do not leave tiny egg bubbles, when baking it will blur the patterns and the cake surface will be patchy and unattractive.
‚Äì After brushing the egg, put the cake in the oven and continue baking at 230 degrees Celsius for another 5 minutes. Take the cake out. At this point, you can choose to spray water a second time, or not, because I have tested both cases: spraying water once and spraying water twice, the results of the cake are the same. If you spray water, you need to let the cake evaporate, then brush the egg a second time. Brushing the egg a second time is necessary to make the color of the cake even and dark.
‚Äì After brushing the egg a second time, put the cake in the oven for another 6-8 minutes until the cake turns light golden brown. Take the cake out, let it cool, wrap it tightly with nylon, leave the cake for 2 days until the color of the cake fades, the crust softens because it absorbs the oil, the cake is now very shiny and beautiful.
The cake after baking for a few hours, has this color.
The cake will turn darker after 2 days. At this point, you can put the cake in a tray and bag, it will look like this ^^
Can I give this cake to my relatives and friends ?

Title: Experience in choosing moon cake molds
Ingredients:
Many women have become very professional and making moon cakes is really easy, not as difficult as many people think. For many young people who are new to baking, the moon cake field seems to be very new and difficult, but it does not reduce their enthusiasm to try. I often receive questions asking for advice on how to choose a moon cake mold, how to make cakes, what ingredients, etc. Therefore, to be complete, I decided to write an article sharing my personal experience in choosing a moon cake mold.
Wooden mold, plastic mold, spring mold, silicone mold, which mold to choose?
1. Wooden molds are the most traditional and ‚Äúancient‚Äù molds. Those who are traditional and classical will still choose wooden molds, perhaps because they love the feeling of holding a heavy wooden mold, knocking the cake down and making a ‚Äúthud‚Äù to make the cake fall out. But over time and with the development of new tools, wooden molds have shown their limitations compared to plastic molds:
‚Äì The price is much higher than plastic molds. A wooden mold has only one pattern (pattern), if you want many patterns (faces), you have to buy many molds => costs a lot of money.
‚Äì More difficult to preserve and clean. Washing wooden molds is very difficult and takes a lot of time to clean the pattern gaps. If not washed properly, mold can easily form. With hot and humid weather conditions and lots of rain like in Vietnam, most molds will easily form mold.
‚Äì Wooden molds are often heavy and bulky, larger than plastic molds, so they will take up more space in the storage cabinet, making it more inconvenient to carry when needed.
‚Äì Every time you use a wooden mold, you have to soak it in oil for a few days to let it absorb the oil, especially with a new mold, when making a new cake, you still need to use a lot of flour. Using a lot of flour will make the cake pattern not sharp. If the wooden mold is not carved skillfully, the patterns will not be even and the cake will not be sharp.
5 or 6 years ago, when I first made mooncakes, and when plastic molds were not yet popular, I bought wooden molds, but in the following years I no longer used wooden molds.
2. Plastic mold
‚Äì The plastic mold has a handle and is exactly like the wooden mold, except the material is plastic. The advantage is that it is much cheaper, lighter, but the cake is not as comfortable to knock as the wooden mold.
‚Äì Cheap plastic molds often have dull patterns and few modern patterns.
3. Spring mold
‚Äì In recent years, spring-loaded moon cake molds have become increasingly popular because they have many superior properties to wooden and plastic molds.
‚Äì The price is cheaper or equal to wooden molds, the plastic material is hard, the spring is sturdy so the mold still feels very "comfortable" when held in hand.
‚Äì Cleaning the mold is very easy and clean, never worry about mold. The mold is light and compact, very easy to store.
‚Äì Perhaps the best thing is that spring-loaded molds often have many patterned sides for one mold, so you can freely change the appearance of the cake.
‚Äì Using a springform pan, when taking the cake out it is very light and easy, almost no worry of the cake sticking.
‚Äì Spring molds have many youthful, modern, cute, romantic, and child-friendly cake patterns, so many people like them. Every year, spring molds have new patterns, generally very up-to-date üòÄ
‚Äì The spring mold is industrially engraved by machine so the pattern is very sharp.
4. Silicone mold
Silicone molds, or thin, transparent plastic molds are used to make jelly mooncakes, also known as TT jelly cakes. In recent years, many people have made jelly cakes with the same appearance on the outside, and inside, as traditional mooncakes. The cakes are also quite interesting, making the Mid-Autumn Festival atmosphere more diverse. These molds cannot be used to make traditional mooncakes. Only jelly mooncakes ^^
How to choose mold size?
TT cake molds are sized by the weight of the cake. Currently on the market there are mold sizes: 50g, 75g, 100g, 125g, 150g and 200g.
‚ÄúIn the old days‚Äù, TT cakes were popular in the weight of 150g and 200g, the cakes were big and heavy as in the memories of many people of my generation. In recent years, the trend of making smaller TT cakes has become popular, perhaps because moon cakes are quite sweet so people don‚Äôt eat much. Small cakes under 100g look very cute, very cute. Many mothers make cakes for their children with the shape of kitty, doraemon, so they make tiny cakes of 50g, the children will love it.
Therefore, depending on the purpose of making the cake: to give to the elderly, to give to your lover, to give to friends, or to give to children... you can choose the appropriate pattern and mold size.
See you in the article about ingredients for making moon cakes. This is also an article to summarize and answer questions of many people who are new to making moon cakes, because I am also being asked these related questions by many of you üôÇ

Title: Vegetarianism and Health (Part 2)
Ingredients:
Of course, we can still survive if we eat ‚Äúsalty‚Äù food normally, but a vegetarian diet helps our body‚Äôs machinery to function more efficiently and be much healthier, countless studies have shown that vegetarians around the world are very healthy. Some examples:
‚Äì Tribes and mountain people who live mainly on vegetarian diets often have very long life expectancy, such as the Hunza people in India who live to be over 115 years old, a group of 400 people in the mountains of Ecuador who live to be over 100 years old were thoroughly examined and only 2 people showed signs of heart disease, if such an examination were done on Americans it would show that 95% of people have heart disease.
‚Äì Vegetarian children have better teeth, are less likely to get colds and allergies than non-vegetarian children, are less likely to be obese, and have less heart disease.
‚Äì Vegetarians are not weak, pale and sickly as many people mistakenly think, but on the contrary, they are healthier, more agile, and have higher endurance.
‚Äì Many world record-breaking athletes are vegetarians.
=> Have you noticed that in the world, the strongest and longest-living animals are all herbivores: horses, cows, buffaloes, elephants...
Is it nutritious to not eat meat?
This is a question that most people wonder, or more specifically, is there enough protein, because when mentioning meat, people mention protein - the most essential nutrient for the body because most of our body tissues are made up of protein. However, eating too much protein is harmful to health, as many people are misled by advertising campaigns. In fact, we need much less protein than we think, and eating too much protein is harmful to the liver, kidneys and leads to many diseases. Excess protein will be converted into carbohydrates and stored as fat.
Another misconception is that many people think that the protein in vegetables is inferior to the protein in meat. Soybeans are extremely rich in protein, containing twice the amount of protein found in meat. (Soybeans have 40% protein, the best steak has only 20% usable protein). Many nutritious nuts such as walnuts, beans... contain 30% protein.
Soybeans, the miracle bean
Every day, more than 1 billion people in the world eat a source of protein that was only recently discovered in the West: tofu, made from soybeans, a nutritious and inexpensive food. Eastern people have eaten soybeans for thousands of years. Soybeans are called by many names such as: miracle tree, golden diamond, magic bean, gold from the earth, meat growing on vines... because of their high protein content and richness in vitamins and minerals (all 8 essential amino acids in appropriate proportions). Soy protein is therefore better digested, it does not contain hard fat, does not contain fattening starch, is low in calories, does not contain cholesterol, does not contain chemicals, and does not carry animal infections. Soybeans also contain more B vitamins than all other plant foods, and are rich in vitamins A and D.
Carbohydrates: fuel for the body
Carbohydrates (carbs) provide the heat and energy needed for daily activities. When vegetarian, the main source of carbs is cereals, beans, sugar, fruits, potatoes... We need less carbs than our bodies actually eat, and we often eat too many empty calories - carbs that contain a lot of calories but little vitamins, minerals and protein, specifically eating too much rice, bread, and sweets. And so, today there is a tendency for us to choose less refined foods, such as eating whole grains, barley bread, rye, red rice, brown rice...
Sugar: ‚Äúwhite poison‚Äù ‚Äì Glucose: is the body‚Äôs main source of energy, the brain needs it very much. It is created from the carbs we eat such as sugar in fruits, vegetables and dairy products, starches. Sucrose is the refined sugar we use every day (white granulated sugar): this sugar provides empty calories but lacks many vitamins and minerals, so daily sugar is not good for health. To reduce sugar in the body, we replace it with honey, malt, maple syrup, fruit, cut down on candy, bottled soft drinks‚Ä¶
Fat: for vegetarians, fat sources come from vegetable oils, milk, butter, cheese, nuts, etc. Natural vegetable oils contain many essential fats that meat does not have, and do not produce cholesterol.
Mineral salts:
‚Äì Iron: food sources include brewer's yeast, wheat germ, dried fruits (apricots, prunes, raisins), soybeans, amaranth, beets...
‚Äì Calcium: almonds, milk, sesame, amaranth, soybeans, dried apricots..
‚Äì Iodine: amaranth, milk, red beets, coarse salt
‚Äì Phosphorus: dairy products, brewer's yeast, wheat bran and germ, rice bran, nuts, etc.
‚Äì Magnesium: walnuts, soybeans, leafy vegetables,
‚Äì Vitamins: found in most vegetables. Vitamin A is found in carrots, green vegetables, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, apricots, milk... Vitamin B is found in nuts, yeast, wheat germ, rice bran, almonds... Vitamin C is found in fruits, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, tangerines, tomatoes, green vegetables... Vitamin D is found in avocados, milk... Vitamin E is found in soybeans, sweet potatoes, beans, avocados, kale...

Title: Wagashi ‚Äì Japanese confectionery art
Ingredients:
The word ‚Äúwagashi‚Äù comes from the word ‚Äúkashi‚Äù, which means ‚Äúcandy‚Äù or sweets, but in the past, ‚Äúkashi‚Äù referred to nuts, berries and fruits. The word ‚Äúwagashi‚Äù was first used during the Meiji period to distinguish it from Western sweets (wa ‚Äì the word for Japan).
Wagashi originated in the Yayoi period (300 BC), when wagashi were simply sweets made from fruits and nuts. As the technique of grinding grains developed, wagashi was greatly influenced when flour made from wheat, glutinous rice, rice, beans and other grains was used to make wagashi. The sweetness of the cakes previously depended on the natural sweetness of fruits and nuts, but the production of sugar changed the formula for creating sweetness for cakes.
During the Edo period (1603), wagashi really flourished along with trade between Japan and foreign countries. If before only the upper class could enjoy wagashi, now wagashi became much more popular and entered the middle class. Wagashi began to appear regularly in tea parties, afternoon snacks, and were especially used as luxurious gifts.
Over the centuries, although wagashi has been heavily influenced by Western cultural elements, wagashi is still regarded as a symbol of Japanese artistic aesthetics.
Wagashi is divided into three main groups, classified based on the moisture content of the cake or the method of making the cake.
The moisture content of the cake is a very important factor in determining the "shelf life" of the cake.
If divided by baking method, for example, wagashi has the following types:
To fully appreciate the uniqueness of wagashi, we must enjoy it with all five senses: seeing with our eyes, smelling with our nose, ‚Äúhearing with our ears‚Äù, touching with our hands, and then tasting with our mouths. Each wagashi is unique in its design, and the shaping of each cake must highlight the natural beauty of each season at the present time. For example, in the spring when cherry blossoms bloom, we will see many cake designs inspired by flowers, petals, cherry blossom colors, and even cherry leaves are used to make cakes.
Why is it said that enjoying wagashi can be heard by hearing, that is because the cake can be named after a symbol, a beautiful natural phenomenon of each season, or named after lyrics in poetry, music. When hearing those poetic names, the person enjoying the cake will be able to use his imagination to draw beautiful and poetic natural scenes.
The taste of wagashi should not be too sweet or too bland, but should be balanced and harmonious. Red beans (azuki beans) are one of the main ingredients of wagashi, in addition to wheat flour, rice flour, sesame, taro, sugar, and agar powder (kanten). Therefore, wagashi is not only delicious but also good for your health.
If you come to Japan, don't miss exploring the beautiful world of wagashi.

Title: Summer cocktail ‚Äì Passion fruit paloma
Ingredients:
‚Äì 1 1/2 oz tequila
‚Äì 1 passion fruit, squeeze to get the juice
‚Äì 1 oz honey
‚Äì juice of 1/2 lemon
‚Äì A few ice cubes
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Banh it, banh ram
Ingredients:
Banh it, with shrimp and meat filling is as simple as banh bot loc or banh beo. After cleaning the shrimp and meat, stir-fry until cooked. Banh it also kneads sticky rice flour with a little salt and warm water until smooth, dry, and can be shaped into balls. Put the shrimp and meat filling in the middle and wrap it into small round balls, each about 2-3cm in diameter, with a shrimp and a piece of meat inside. This cake needs to be wrapped in banana leaves or food grade nylon and steamed until cooked.
Once both types of cakes are ready, place the banh it on top of the ram cake, use a spoon to press the banh it flat and stick it to the ram cake.
This dish is eaten with a dipping sauce made from boiled shrimp shells with fish sauce, sugar, garlic, chili, vinegar or lemon.
This time I was curious and wanted to try making it, but after I finished it, I was too tired. The ingredients were not complicated, but when I made it, I had to tear this and that, a little bit of each, and then when I came back to wash the dishes, I saw a pile. It was quite delicious but filled me up quickly because it was sticky rice cake.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Converting commonly used materials
Ingredients:
Normally, to make it easier to measure ingredients used in cooking and baking, the kitchen must have a scale and a measuring cup with divisions in cups and ml. The smaller the scale division, the more accurate it is. Of course, if you can afford an electronic scale, it will be much easier to measure. A regular measuring cup like the one above has the largest division up to 2 cups, the quality of the cup and the price also depend on the material and "brand". However, this does not have a big impact on the quality of the cake you want to make, as long as you are careful when measuring the ingredients.
Measuring ingredients in which system of measurement is a flexible thing. When you do a lot of things, you will form a habit of which unit of measurement to use so that you do not have to "get tangled up" with many utensils and dishes, which will waste time washing.

Title: How to make Banh bot loc with shrimp and meat filling
Ingredients:
The shrimp and meat filling is simple, just peeled shrimp, sliced pork belly, marinated with fish sauce, pepper, shallots, stir-fried until cooked.
Spread banana leaves on a flat surface, scoop a little tapioca starch mixture, then arrange 1 or 2 pieces of shrimp and meat on top, wrap into a long rectangle, tie with string, and put in a steamer.
Steamer with a lot of water, high heat will help the cake cook faster. I steamed for about 15 minutes and the cake was cooked.
Before eating, heat a little cooking oil, add chopped green onions and stir quickly until the onions are soft. Sprinkle these onions on each piece of cake to make it look more attractive and add more aroma to the cake.
For the dipping sauce, use the water from boiling the shrimp heads and shells instead of using filtered water. In addition, add fish sauce, sugar, and chili vinegar to give the dipping sauce a slightly salty and slightly sweet and sour taste, with a little bit of chili pepper.

Title: Problems with eggs in baking
Ingredients:
In European and American countries and other developed countries, eggs are classified into clear 'grades', depending on the quality, freshness, and size of the eggs. Eggs will be classified as AA, A or B, C, depending on the convention of each country. In Singapore, eggs also have codes, but most of them are all mixed up, every brand is labeled A or AA, big or small eggs are still A, I can only distinguish based on price, the more expensive the type, I think the higher the quality. In Vietnam, people often buy eggs in supermarkets, or more easily, go to the market to buy eggs, then choosing eggs is based on experience and trust in the seller's advice.
Eggs are also an ingredient that cannot be used 'indiscriminately' in baking. In this article, I will summarize what I know and my experience about using eggs, and specific notes about eggs in the baking process.
1. Structure of eggs:
Basically, an egg consists of the shell, the white, and the yolk. This is obvious to everyone.
‚Äì Egg yolks are a source of protein and fat. The color of the yolk depends on the diet of the ‚Ä¶ chicken.
‚Äì Egg whites, when still ‚Äòraw‚Äô, are clear and can dissolve in water. But when cooked or whipped, they will turn opaque white. This is easy to see.
2. Size of the egg:
Eggs are not only classified based on quality but also by size. When baking, we often encounter notes such as using large eggs, etc. Large eggs are the most commonly used type in baking.
According to American standards, excluding the eggshell, the average weight of a large egg is as follows:
‚Äì whole: 47g
‚Äì egg whites separately: 28g
‚Äì egg yolk: 19g
3. Function of eggs for cakes:
‚Äì The protein in eggs contributes to the structure of the cake because the protein has the property of coagulating and hardening when exposed to heat. Therefore, if used in an unreasonable ratio, too many eggs will make the cake hard or chewy.
‚Äì The water content in eggs is quite high so the eggs will create moisture for the cake.
‚Äì Eggs add aroma and flavor to the cake.
‚Äì Beaten eggs create air holes and bubbles, which helps make the cake fluffy.
‚Äì Egg yolks are used to brush on the surface of cakes (such as bread) to create a more attractive color for the cake.
4. Experience in egg preservation:
‚Äì For those who often bake, buying and storing eggs at home is very normal to save the effort of buying many times and to conveniently use them whenever needed.
‚Äì Like me, every time I buy eggs, I usually buy a tray of 30. When buying in the supermarket, it is difficult to know at the time of purchase how fresh the eggs are. When going to the market in Vietnam, if you buy at a familiar store, the seller will tell you which eggs are new and which are old, and will not recommend that acquaintances buy them.
‚Äì When buying eggs, I usually keep them in a dry, airy, cool place, avoiding contact with water and odors from other foods (the fragile eggshell will absorb odors).
‚Äì When you buy a large quantity of eggs, you should avoid leaving them out for too long. If you still have not used them all after a week, you should put them in the refrigerator.
5. Notes when using eggs to make cakes:
‚Äì Eggs should be kept at room temperature. If you take eggs out of the refrigerator, leave them outside to cool down.
‚Äì For recipes that require separating the egg whites and yolks, separate carefully to avoid getting the egg whites mixed with the yolks.
‚Äì Factors affecting the ability to whip egg whites:
+ Eggs that are not fresh will lose their ability to be stiff, making them difficult or impossible to whip. Normally, eggs will stiffen easily after being whipped a little.
+ Egg whites that are wet or have yolks; bowls or beaters that are not dry or clean will also affect the egg beating.
Hopefully the above sharing will help everyone in some way with the use of eggs in cooking in general and baking in particular. If there is anything else I remember, I will add it later.

Title: Milk and dairy products
Ingredients:
The most popular cheese made from milk and used most in baking is cream cheese. Next are the Italian cheeses that are also used a lot: Mascarpone and Ricotta.
Talking about cheese is another long topic, you can learn more in the article I shared: Distinguishing types of cheese.
Phew, I have to stop writing here, go to the kitchen to get some milk and make a cappuccino before I can continue working. Hope you all have fun baking in the kitchen.

Title: 12 types of nuts for baking
Ingredients:
In this article, I have compiled the names and images of the nuts commonly used in baking, so that beginners who are new to baking will not be confused when entering a store selling baking ingredients, so that they can immediately recognize which type of nut it is. In stores, nuts are often sold as whole nuts, split in half or coarsely chopped. When purchased, they need to be stored in sealed packaging and kept in a dry place, away from light.
This is the most important nut in baking and is very popular. It is naturally brown in skin. There are also white skinned varieties. Stores usually sell whole almonds, almond halves, sliced almonds, or ground almonds/almond meal.
This type of seed is very delicious ^^ I don't know how to describe it, but every Christmas, mixed seed packages are often sold a lot in supermarkets, and there will always be this type of seed. This type of seed is also rare in Vietnam.
This type of nut is very familiar to Vietnamese people ^^ Cashew nuts are used in baking and in many dishes.
This type of nut in shell looks a bit like the small chestnuts commonly found in Vietnam. However, the Western hazelnut is not that type of chestnut. In Vietnam, many people call this nut hazelnut. Hazelnut is very delicious when used to make cakes.
Based on the shape, I guess this type of chestnut is the type that Vietnamese people still call Chongqing chestnuts - large seeds, the inside is golden yellow when ripe. Chestnuts must be boiled or roasted before being used to prepare dishes.
Coconut is so familiar üòâ Most cakes that use coconut are shredded or shredded. Coconut can be in its moist or dried form. Many recipes use the phrase ‚Äúdesiccated coconut‚Äù to refer to shredded/shredded and dried coconut.
This type of seed does not have an equivalent name in Vietnamese, but it is known to be very delicious and very expensive.
This is also a very expensive nut, usually only high-end cakes "dare" to use this nut.
In contrast to the expensive nuts above, peanuts are very popular in Vietnam and are also very cheap. Vietnamese people often use peanuts in dishes. There are cake recipes using peanuts which also create a characteristic aroma for the cake.
This type of nut comes from the pine tree (large pine cone), which is also not cheap. Italian cakes often use this type of nut.
This type of seed is often used for decoration because of its attractive green color. Vietnamese people are no longer unfamiliar with this type of seed.
Derived from walnuts. Along with almonds and hazelnuts, this is a very important nut in baking because walnuts are used quite a lot in cakes.

Title: Other steps in the bread making process
Ingredients:
1. Kneading time and kneading speed.
Under-kneading or over-kneading both reduce the dough's ability to rise.
For those who have a bread dough kneader, this is not a complicated problem. The kneader already has a time and speed mode, just follow the recipe instructions for how long to knead, at what speed and follow. However, you should not rely entirely on those reference numbers, because they are only for reference. Because the kneader itself also has different sizes, capacities, and powers. Therefore, you need to refer to the specific user manual for that machine.
For those who don‚Äôt have a bread machine (like mine), it all depends on how your hands feel. It‚Äôs hard to say how many minutes is enough because each person has different strength and speed.
Therefore, whether kneading by machine or by hand, visual assessment and hand feel are still the most important. This will be achieved through practice and experience. A well-kneaded dough will feel smooth, elastic and chewy, not sticky.
2. Ferment and let the dough rise
Fermentation is the process by which yeast interacts with sugars and starches to produce CO2 and alcohol. Under-fermented dough will not reach the correct volume and the texture of the cake will be coarse.
Dough that is fermented at too high a temperature or for too long will become sticky, difficult to work with, and slightly sour.
3. Fold or punch the dough
After the fermentation process is complete, the dough needs to be folded (traditionally called ‚Äúpunching‚Äù the dough) to flatten the risen dough. However, this process is not simply a matter of ‚Äúpunching‚Äù the dough, but rather a series of folding the dough over and over again, with the aim of removing CO2 gas and distributing the yeast and temperature more evenly throughout the dough.
So you can imagine this stage as the movements of stretching the dough out, folding it and pressing it, then stretching the dough out again, folding it and pressing it again.
4. Divide the dough
Depending on the size of the bread you want to make, divide the large dough into smaller dough pieces of equal weight. This should be done quickly to avoid giving the dough too much time and causing it to ferment too much.
5. Round shape
After dividing the dough into equal pieces, each small piece of dough is shaped into a smooth, spherical shape. This is also the shape that allows the dough to rise best during the resting process before baking.
6. Let the dough rest:
Each round dough will be left to ‚Äúrest‚Äù for 10-20 minutes. The dough is placed on a flat surface, using a tool such as a pot, pan, or box to cover the dough.
7. Shape and transfer to baking tray
This step depends on the type of bread you want to make, and on your creativity and skill to create delicious bread shapes.
8. Proofing (I don't know the equivalent Vietnamese word)
This is the next step in the fermentation process to make the dough rise to the standard volume. The temperature of the proofing process is higher than the fermentation process.
My family usually puts the baking tray in the oven, the oven turns on for about 30 seconds to just above the outside temperature. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size. If the dough doesn't rise enough , the bread will be dense and hard when baked. If the dough rises too much, it will lose its aroma and the texture of the bread will be rough.
9. Baking
a. Oven temperature and baking time.
Baking times vary depending on the type and size of the cake. Here are some basic rules for adjusting oven temperature.
‚Äì Large cakes are baked at a lower temperature and for a longer time than small or long cakes.
‚Äì Sweet or buttered bread is baked at a lower time to avoid the bread from browning and burning quickly.
‚Äì The cake is done when the crust reaches a golden brown color and when squeezed, you will hear a delicious crispy popping sound.
b. ‚ÄúWash‚Äù the powder
Essentially, this is the process of spreading or spraying some kind of liquid onto the dough surface, which can be water, eggs or a starch mixture.
‚Äì Bread with a hard crust is usually brushed or sprayed with water, and it is even better if the oven has a water spray system during baking. The steam will prevent the crust from drying out too quickly, thus ensuring a thin yet crispy crust.
‚Äì Eggs to make the surface of the bread shiny brown, often seen with sweet butter bread.
c. Slit the dough
The slits on the cake help the cake rise better during baking. Usually, there is a special knife for slitting, the slits will be sharper and more precise. My family does not have one, so we often use a razor blade, which makes the slits a bit difficult and therefore limits the cake from rising, making the slits stand out beautifully.
d. Put the cake in the oven
The dough will be very soft after proofing so it needs to be handled carefully. Usually with bread, the baking tray is placed on the lowest groove in the bottom.
e. Cooling
Once baked, remove from pan/baking pan and cool on rack immediately.
That's all the steps to make a batch of bread. Making bread is actually very elaborate, but in return the aroma of the bread when baked spreads throughout the house, the house smells like the oven, thinking about it is also interesting ^^

Title: Kneading step in bread making process
Ingredients:
In this article I will share the knowledge I have gained about the process of mixing ingredients together.
The mixing step is to accomplish three purposes:
‚Äì Combine all ingredients to form a uniform dough.
‚Äì Distribute yeast evenly throughout the dough.
‚Äì Creates conditions for gluten to develop.
There are three basic methods used with yeast dough (to keep things simple, I will use the word ‚Äúbread‚Äù here to refer to ‚Äúyeast dough‚Äù).
1. Whole wheat bread:
‚Äì Soften the yeast with a little water:
+ With fresh yeast: the amount of water is twice the amount of yeast. The ideal water temperature is 38 degrees Celsius.
+ With active dry yeast: water amount is 4 times the amount of yeast. Ideal water temperature is 43 degrees Celsius.
‚Äì Put all the remaining ingredients into a large mixing bowl, add the yeast mixed with water, avoid letting the yeast come into direct contact with the salt right away (therefore, when making it, L usually keeps the salt separate and mixes it in last after the yeast has been mixed into the flour).
‚Äì Knead into a uniform dough.
2. Sweet bread:
‚Äì Soften the yeast (same method as above).
‚Äì Combine fat, sugar, salt, milk, flavoring, mix well.
‚Äì Add eggs slowly.
‚Äì Add liquid and mix quickly.
‚Äì Add dry flour and yeast. Mix into a uniform dough.
3. Sponge cake:
‚Äì Combine liquid, yeast with 1 part flour (sometimes with 1 part sugar), mix into a soft dough and let this dough double in size.
‚Äì Squeeze the air out of the risen dough, add the remaining flour and other ingredients, knead into a uniform dough.

‚Äì 4 tbs. apricot (or peach) jam
* For almond cream:
‚Äì 115g whole almonds
‚Äì 50g sugar (fine grain)
‚Äì 65g butter
‚Äì 1 egg + 1 egg white

Title: This Mid-Autumn Festival... let's make moon cakes :)
Ingredients:
I like eating mooncakes, the only reason is because they are not as sweet as the mooncake crust, the kind of cake that I often complain about being too sweet, why do I have to make it so sweet. But making mooncakes is really a feat. To make the cake especially delicious, people have to boil sugar water and leave it for a year, from this year's Mid-Autumn Festival to next year's Mid-Autumn Festival, they will be made. That is for the hard-working and capable women who make their own cakes every year, industrial cakes are probably not like this. Although I really want to try making mooncakes, I can't find enough ingredients here, so I'll just try making mooncakes first.
The first time I made it, I had no experience, I ruined a batch of dough and had to throw it away. After that, I made 3 more batches and they were very good, each batch mixed a different color of dough, traditional white, green from pandan leaves, and pink from strawberry paste. But there was only one type of filling, green tea. The red bean filling was too soft and difficult to shape into balls, so it couldn't be used as filling. This time was also my first experience using salted eggs. Since I was a kid, I've only touched salted eggs "in shell", I didn't know how to make them so I just did it randomly, luckily it turned out right.
After a while of struggling to knead, roll and bang the wooden mold loudly, the whole family finally got an acceptable tray like this (missed a tiny one because my brother ate it secretly).
After cleaning up a battlefield, I sat down and folded paper boxes to put the cakes in to give as gifts. Although I really wanted to make more, after finishing 3 batches of dough, I was too dizzy, so I had to do this. These are 3 gift boxes for my ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù, as for my boyfriend, I only need quantity, no need for fancy things üòõ
Tonight after dinner, we will have a ‚Äúparty‚Äù, but we are missing the moon watching. I remember the old days when we sat on the high, wide terrace, where many children from the neighborhood gathered, ate the ‚Äúparty‚Äù to their heart‚Äôs content, and then went out to carry lanterns. My party this year is simple, but it is also the first time I have had a mid-autumn festival party since I came here. There is only grapefruit, and I miss so much pickled persimmons.
I remember in year 1, I was excited to go to Yunnan Garden for Mid-Autumn Festival and definitely had to carry lanterns. A few days after that Mid-Autumn Festival, my American teacher ‚ÄúClicker‚Äù from Vietnam brought me a box of 4 Kinh Do cakes. He was so thoughtful, before leaving for Vietnam he asked me if I wanted him to bring anything. This time, after 3 years, I was able to make my own cakes, unfortunately the teacher was no longer in Singapore to invite him. This year, I also went for a lantern procession, also wrote and hung wishes, also scribbled and stuck a lantern... and hoped... hoped..
And hope everyone had a meaningful and happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
