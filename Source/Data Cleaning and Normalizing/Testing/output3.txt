Title: Carrot Bread
Ingredients:
Why is that just the first step, because the next step is baking, if the temperature and time are not reasonable, it can also lead to a batch of bread being ruined. For example, with this batch of bread, I set the time in advance, then went to pick up my child, planning to go home just in time. But when I got home, although the time was not up yet, the surface of the bread was already a bit darker than I expected. The surface, sides and bottom of the bread were all overcooked. Therefore, during the baking process, it is best to be present so that you can take ‚Äúimmediate action‚Äù when observing the situation of the bread in the oven.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Pizza rolls
Ingredients:
Today I tried to overcome my ‚Äúshyness‚Äù and made this pizza roll for my kids. In general, the extra rolling step significantly increased the time to complete this dish. But in return, after the pizza was out of the oven, the children‚Äôs joy and cheers made me feel that it was worth it. Every now and then, a little decoration brings simple joy to the kids and vice versa, the adults can also share that joy.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Lemon brownies
Ingredients:
I baked this batch of cookies for 30 minutes. But I found that if I baked them for only 25 minutes, the cookies would be more moist, more like brownies. Therefore, in the recipe below, I set the baking time to 25 minutes. If your cookies are more moist than the ones in my picture, rest assured that they are still perfect.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Coffee cheesecake
Ingredients:
I made an Oreo recipe which is enough to make both the base and sides for a 20cm cheesecake like this. If you are just making the base without the sides, half the recipe will be enough.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Crumble lemon cheesecake bars
Ingredients:
NZ is in the lavender season. The photo above is my family taking advantage of the "early season" ????, the flowers have not yet bloomed, now that it is the season, I have not arranged to go again. This flower really fascinates me. I like flowers with small, pretty flowers more than those with big flowers. That day, my family freely picked a lot of fresh lavender. Now we are drying them to get dried flowers to make the house smell good.
Many people often do not pre-bake the crust, but I do not like the crust to be moist or soft, so I bake the crust separately until it is about 60% cooked, then I add the filling and bake it again. The result is that both the crust and the topping are crispy and very fragrant.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Molasses instant oats cookies
Ingredients:
These days of late winter and early spring, do you know what is abundant in NZ? It is magnolia. Since living in NZ, I have been able to see the beauty of magnolia with my own eyes. In this country, there are white, bright pink and dark pink flowers, I find every color of flower fascinating, it is true that each flower has its own charm.
The tall magnolia trees were in full bloom, even though winter was still more than half a month away. Some trees had pure white flowers, while others had ivory-white flowers, like a painting.
White fence, magnolia tree covered in bright pink and red, standing out against the blue sky with a few white clouds, what do you think? There are images that I used to only see on pictures on the internet, but now I can see them with my own eyes, I feel so lucky.
As usual, on weekends, if it doesn‚Äôt rain, my husband and I will take a walk around where we live, looking at the sky, the land, the trees and discovering what has changed, which trees are blooming, which trees are budding, and in the fall, which trees are changing color, which trees have lost all their leaves. These are the most relaxing and wonderful times.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Parsley and cheese scones
Ingredients:
Scones are easy to make, but for some people they are still considered difficult to make. The difficulty is how to make the cake not tough, not too hard and dense, but need to be spongy, the inside of the cake is soft, moist, and the cake is not dry.
Every time I make scones, I usually make a lot, then put them in the fridge, every morning I will take them out and heat them for about 30 seconds to keep them hot, let the kids eat them for breakfast in rotation with other dishes. Next time I will introduce other delicious scones to everyone ????
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Piccalilli and cheese toast
Ingredients:
1 tbsp piccalilli - substitute with other type of your choice
--------------------------------------------------
Title: How to make beef stew bread
Ingredients:
For beef stew, I like to use the beef with a lot of tendons the most. The beef tendon is stewed until soft, the tendons are still crispy and the meat is not mushy. The part of beef I like to use the most, also influenced by my mother, is the ribs, which are both tendons and tough, and not too meaty, making delicious beef stews or beef stew soups. I usually only like to use lean beef in stir-fried beef dishes.
This part of beef has a lot of fat because it is not completely lean. That is why this dish needs to be eaten while it is still hot, because if the dish cools down, the fat layer from the beef will form, making the dish no longer delicious.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Walnut brownies with caramel sauce
Ingredients:
The second secret is not to overbake when making brownies. The characteristic of brownies is softness and moisture, do not see the cake is still moist and think that the cake is not cooked yet and try to bake it more, when baking more the cake will dry out, losing the soft and moist nature of the brownie. When you first make it, you should choose the right type and size of pan recommended in the recipe, set the oven to the right temperature, and watch the right time to take the cake out of the oven before it is overbaked. Many bakers accept a slightly underbaked cake rather than overbaked, the cake is still delicious and do not be afraid that the cake will not be cooked.
Once you get used to it and make many different types of brownies, you will gain experience in how to test when the brownie is done, and from there you will be able to change the recipe according to different sizes of molds and trays, and change the temperature and baking time more proficiently.
Today's brownie is special because it has a special structure, so it is much taller than regular brownie.

Title: Learn about Tiramisu cake and Kokotaru's recipe
Ingredients:
Linh brings up this issue because more and more people are making Tiramisu and selling it online for only 70-80K/big box (a rectangular food storage box) and advertising it as delicious. Linh can only smile sadly. How can ‚Äúreal‚Äù Tiramisu be so cheap, the cost of the ingredients is not enough, let alone‚Ä¶
The longest time to keep this cake in the refrigerator is only 3-4 days, and the cake should be kept in a sealed box, avoid leaving the cake exposed as it will lose its aroma and absorb the smell of other foods in the refrigerator.
You can also freeze tiramisu if for some reason you need to make it in advance, or make too much and can't eat it all at once. After freezing the tiramisu, when you need to use it, you must put it in the refrigerator several hours in advance to let it defrost slowly in the refrigerator. When freezing, it should not be frozen for more than 3 months.
With all the experience, I will share my own best classic Tiramisu recipe, which has been changed a bit compared to other recipes.
Hope you make some delicious tiramisu for your family to enjoy!

Ingredients:
But everything has its price? No matter how complicated the cake is, the result is that the whole family can enjoy a delicious cake. This is the kind of cake that once you eat it, you want to eat more, but you don't want to finish it all, and once you finish it, you have to wait until you feel like it to go back to the kitchen to make it again. Hehe.

(for 21-23cm diameter removable bottom pan. Recipe learned from joyofbaking.com, modified)
‚Äì Turn on the oven at 177 degrees Celsius.
‚Äì Add 1/3 of flour mixture to egg mixture, use a large spatula to mix gently and evenly. Continue mixing in the remaining 1/2 of the flour, then mix in the last portion of flour. Do not mix too long, too thoroughly, or too vigorously, or the eggs will deflate.

‚Äì Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Keep the melted chocolate warm.
‚Äì Put the egg yolks in a large bowl and set aside.
‚Äì If the mixture is a bit runny after mixing, put it in the refrigerator until it is hard enough (several hours or overnight).
My Valentine's gift this year is the latest edition of Professional Baking book. My love is so wonderful. This book is exactly what I've been wishing for for a long time (since I knew there was such a book ^^). I don't have to read the old library book anymore.

Title: Common mistakes when baking
Ingredients:
Hehe, I think this error does not need to be explained further. Sometimes I do not know what you should do differently, especially when you are new to baking. Later, when you have more experience, you may not need to follow each step closely, you can draw your own experiences. But when you are new to baking, just follow the instructions as I did, it will limit mistakes a lot.
Linh has briefly summarized the common errors above, hoping that it will be helpful to you. Linh will add more to the article if she remembers anything important that is missing.

Title: 4 ways to make Flan ‚Äì Creme caramel simple but delicious
Ingredients:
When steaming flan, you need to be a little more skillful and meticulous so that the surface of the flan does not have water dripping down and making the surface of the cake pitted. You need to cover the mouth of the cups with a clean towel, and use another towel to cover the mouth of the steamer so that the rising water does not drip down onto the surface of the cake. Occasionally open the lid of the pot to let some of the water in the lid escape, reducing the risk of dripping onto the surface of the cake.
After steaming for enough time (the time depends on the size of your container, shallow or deep, so there is no fixed time), you check by shaking gently to see if the flan has set. When hot, the flan will feel a bit too soft, but when it cools down and especially after being chilled, the flan will set and become firmer.
Making flan in the oven is much easier. You don‚Äôt need to cover the cup, just put it in the oven, just make sure the water in the baking tray doesn‚Äôt dry out too much.
Very simple right, and I always cook beautiful and delicious caramel just by cooking this way.
How long can flan be kept?
If after baking, you cover it tightly, put it in the refrigerator, and maintain a stable low temperature below 5 degrees Celsius, you can keep the cake for about a week.
If the temperature of the refrigerator compartment changes frequently due to frequent opening and closing, the shelf life of the cake will only be a few days, sometimes only 2-3 days.
Spoiled flan will turn sour and become inedible.
I have tried many flan recipes, and this is the one I like best. Following this recipe, the flan is dense, smooth, and can be cut into pieces without breaking into pieces, and is still very soft when eaten.
Keep these flan cups in the fridge to cool down, eating one or two cups a day is great.

Title: Honey Castella ‚Äì Kasutera honey cake
Ingredients:
In the 16th century, this type of cake was introduced to Japan by the Portuguese, and since then it has become a "specialty" of the Nagasaki region. The traditional mold for making this type of cake is a bottomless wooden mold, but most of us do not have this type of mold. To somewhat simulate the wooden mold, I followed the instructions online and used two square molds, size 18cm with a solid bottom and 20cm with a removable bottom. Place the 18cm mold inside the 20cm mold, and in the space between the two molds, we will insert 4 pieces of cardboard cut to the size of the mold and cover it with aluminum foil. Why is it necessary to be so ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù? Because this type of cake needs to be baked for a long time (about 40 ‚Äì 50 minutes) at a relatively low temperature (160 degrees Celsius), so that the cake rises slowly and maintains a stable structure. Limiting direct contact of the metal mold with heat also helps the cake to be less dry. The cake is baked at the lowest position in the oven, the purpose is also to let the bottom surface be cooked to a golden brown color like the surface of the cake and the sides of the cake will not burn. However, even though I tried baking this way several times, the bottom of my cake still could not achieve such a thick layer of brown cake. Anyway, this is not a must for this type of cake.

Title: How to make Macarons ‚Äì the charming French cake
Ingredients:
(You should make small batches, with little ingredients like this, if you make a small size of about 4-5cm, you can make 20 pieces of cake, and if they are broken, you won't waste any ingredients, you can make a new batch. A broken cake is one that doesn't have a foot, or has too little foot, almost not visible, the surface of the cake is cracked, but it's still edible, so don't think it's broken and throw it away, it's a waste).

Making this cake takes a bit of time, because we have to make each part of the cake by ourselves, and then we can continue with the next part.

Linh was so happy when this cake was completed beautifully and deliciously as she had imagined, and was really willing to share this cake with her friends.

Linh was even happier when her friends praised the cake and made it delicious. Linh had eaten this cake twice at the bakery outside, but both times she was just curious to see how the cake tasted, and when she made it at home this time, she could clearly analyze the difference.
Linh would like to come here to thank everyone once again, thank Hai Linh and Thuy, thank Hieu and Yen, thank Nguyen's father, Dung's mother, Hung's father, Tuan's father... for working with Linh's mother to create a beautiful and meaningful birthday party for her daughter.

Title: Delicious chocolate cake recipe ‚Äì Chocolate torte
Ingredients:
Because making a cake for a birthday (important and meaningful), I believe that any type of cake must be a bit elaborate. After flipping through the book for a while, I decided to make this cake. I had never made it before, and had to do 4 steps, not to mention shaping and decorating the cake, and I had not tried it yet, so it was a bit risky. Luckily, the cake was delicious beyond imagination (I'm not saying it's too bragging, but the cake was invited to many people to try and everyone praised it as delicious, hehe). My family only has 1 round mold, so I had to divide the cake recipe in half and make 2 batches of cake. If you have 2 round molds, make the full recipe and bake them at the same time, which is faster and less tiring.

Ingredients:
My quiche was quite thin because I only made half of the recipe and the tart pan was too big for the amount of ingredients. If I made enough, the quiche would be thicker, but remember to invite a few friends over to eat with me, because the quiche needs to be eaten while it's still warm, it won't be as delicious when it cools down, and 1 person can only eat 2 thin slices like above (enough to be full and enough to eat more without feeling delicious).

Title: Chestnut candy
Ingredients:
‚Äì Boil the chestnuts, then peel off the skin, pound/grind the kernel or put the kernel into a blender. (Boiled chestnuts are often moist and difficult to blend with a blender. Therefore, let the chestnuts cool and dry before blending. If possible, roast the chestnuts instead of boiling them, which will make them drier and easier to blend.)
‚Äì The way you shape the candy is up to you. You can use cute little candy molds to shape it, or simply like what we do at home, just roll it into a ball and wrap it in a plastic bag.
This candy should be kept in the refrigerator for preservation, it is still delicious when eaten cold.

Title: Basic tools in baking
Ingredients:
That was what inspired Linh to try baking. At first, Linh was confused and full of questions, and had to read a lot before she could start baking. And now, after many years of baking at home, Linh wants to share some of her experiences in preparing baking tools with those who share the same inspiration and interest, to avoid the unnecessary waste and expense that she encountered when she first started the stage of wanting to try everything.
Linh said that because before she started, Linh also thought that only ‚Äúrich people‚Äù could pursue the hobby of baking. But the reality is not like that. Linh is not from a rich family, if not to say that life is still very difficult and the whole family always just barely makes ends meet. However, Linh still finds joy in baking. You just need to have passion!
The items that Linh lists below, along with the minimum quantity and most common sizes, are intended to help you have a comfortable baking experience, but not too wasteful and expensive in the beginning. Rest assured that if you pursue baking, your kitchen will gradually be filled with many separate items, quite different from those regular cooking utensils. But don't be in a hurry, just collect them one by one as you progress through your baking journey.
To choose the right oven, you can refer to the article on how to choose an oven.
Several wooden, silicone, plastic or rubber spatulas. Choose soft, easy-to-use spatulas. Silicone spatulas are now quite cheap and very convenient and do not deform due to heat.
A few large mixing bowls will help you make the most of your baking time. Stainless steel bowls are durable and attractive. You can also choose plastic bowls.
Baking paper. Good paper can be used many times.
1 small scale, maximum about 2kg is enough, the smaller the weight division the better. Small electronic scales are now very cheap, equivalent to a plate scale, very convenient to use.
1 international standard measuring cup, divided into 1 cup, 2 cups‚Ä¶ or ml, oz.
1 set of measuring spoons from large to small, divided into the correct amount of 1 table spoon, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 teaspoon. Many small ingredients are measured with measuring spoons.
1 medium-sized turntable, you can choose the plastic or glass type, the heavier the turntable, the easier and more durable it is to use. The turntable will help you divide the cake layers evenly and beautifully, and cover the cake quickly and easily.
That‚Äôs it for now, for a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù completely different from cooking, there are already many items mentioned. And there are many more extremely interesting baking items waiting for you to discover on your baking journey at home.

Title: Experience in choosing and using a mixer
Ingredients:
Hand mixers usually come with 3 beaters as I mentioned above. And hand mixers will not come with a mixing bowl. Although there are 3 types of beaters, because hand mixers usually have a lower capacity than stand mixers, you almost cannot use the bread dough beaters, but only use the other 2 ends.
Stand mixer is a tabletop mixer. As its name suggests, it needs to be placed on the kitchen counter, and it is much larger than a handheld mixer, so if you want to use it, you have to set aside a place for it. When you buy it, the machine always has a mixing bowl placed on the base of the machine. When you use it, you just need to press the button and the beater will automatically rotate around the mixing bowl. Some types of stand mixers also rotate the mixing bowl. The mixing bowl of a stand mixer can be made of plastic, glass, or stainless steel, these are the 3 most common materials commonly found in stand mixers.
In terms of price, hand mixer is always significantly cheaper than stand mixer. However, using stand mixer is much easier, especially for those who are new to baking and are not familiar with the operations, holding a hand mixer will feel awkward and difficult to control. As for those who are proficient in baking, using a hand mixer is not difficult.
In short, I think that if you have the conditions and bake regularly, having both mixers will help you bake more conveniently and easily.
So if you don't have a mixer yet and are thinking about buying one, first decide whether to buy a stand mixer or a hand mixer.
When you first start baking, Linh advises you not to buy a mixer that is too fancy and expensive right away. (Of course, if money is not a big issue for you, then you can go ahead and buy whatever type you like.)
Linh's advice for a mixer with a reasonable price and very good quality for initial use is a Philips mixer, with a capacity of 350W or more. You can choose a hand mixer or a stand mixer of this brand. In addition, the Blue Stone hand mixer is also quite good, the capacity is large enough, and the machine is quite durable. Linh has used both of these brands.
For those who bake regularly and want to upgrade to a more professional machine, the most popular choice is the KitchenAid mixer, Artisan line. With a Kitchen Aid machine, you can always be assured of the durability and convenience of the machine. It can be said that, up to this point, Kitchen Aid is still the leading prestigious brand in the line of high-end dough mixers serving the level of baking at home or baking in a small bakery, not yet mass-produced in large quantities. In addition to this brand, you can refer to the machine lines of the Kenwood or Cuisinart brands. Currently, Linh's bakery uses a KitchenAid Pro line, the largest capacity type, while at home, Linh uses a Cuisinart machine, and has always been satisfied.
Now, buying a KitchenAid machine in Vietnam is much easier than when I first started baking. You just need to google "buy KitchenAid machine" and you will find websites and shops in Vietnam that sell KitchenAid mixers. The machines sold in Vietnam have the advantage of using 220V voltage, so you don't need to worry about voltage and transformers. Why do I talk about KitchenAid machines in particular and not other machines? Because in the community of people who love baking and cooking in Vietnam, people still prefer KitchenAid machines over other brands of mixers.
If you don't buy in Vietnam but prefer to buy from Amazon, for example, you can now buy easily with today's fast and convenient global shipping service.
I mentioned refurbished / renewed machines because I mentioned buying from Amazon above. There are machines that have minor defects from the manufacturer or during transportation, when they reach the buyer, they are returned and repaired and resold on the market. These machines are not considered new, so they are labeled refurbished / renewed and are always sold at a cheaper price than brand new machines. The nature of these machines is all new because they have not been used, but retailers cannot sell them at the same price as new machines.
I will tell you that all the KitchenAid machines that I have bought are refurbished, I have saved a lot of money by buying refurbished products. However, they are not always available because machines do not have many faults, they only happen occasionally. My refurbished machines have been running smoothly for over a decade now.
Mixer is an indispensable tool in baking, so Linh hopes you will choose an effective mixer to experience the diverse and interesting world of baking.

Title: Distinguishing 12 types of baking flour
Ingredients:
Flour is made from the outer shell of the wheat kernel.

Title: Distinguishing the 10 most popular types of cheese
Ingredients:
Parmesan can be eaten raw or cooked in dishes. When eating, parmesan is usually grated, shredded, sliced or cut into small pieces. You should buy whole blocks of Parmesan and grate it when you want to use it. This type is tastier and retains the cheese flavor better than buying the pre-grated type.
I usually buy large blocks of mozzarella, and when I need to make something, I cut it as needed. Mozzarella is a soft and moist cheese, so it gets moldy very quickly. When you open the package and use a knife to cut it, bacteria can easily penetrate the surface of the cheese, so you shouldn't leave it for too long, and keep it in the chill room of the refrigerator. Remember to use clean hands and a clean knife when cutting mozzarella to extend the shelf life of the leftover cheese.
Pizza is never complete without mozzarella, remember that. Here Linh introduces some non-pizza dishes that use mozzarella that she has made.
Linh would like to introduce to you some variations of Tiramisu.
Here are some dishes with ricotta that Linh has made to share with you.

Title: How to make mixed mooncakes
Ingredients:
Put all the ingredients in a pan, mix them together, then put them on the stove and cook for about 3-5 minutes, until the ingredients become even and stick together. You can test by pinching a little of the ingredients in your hand and squeezing to see if they stick together or fall apart.
‚Äì If the filling is dry and loose, it will be difficult to form a round ball, and when you cut the cake, it will not look nice and the filling will fall out. Therefore, the filling needs to have good adhesion.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: How to make moon cake
Ingredients:
‚Äì Roll the dough into a thin circle, with a diameter large enough to wrap the filling inside.
=> stir well so that the eggs mix with the ingredients and there are no more egg lumps left.
This is the cake tray after pouring the mold.
‚Äì Turn on the oven 20 minutes in advance, at 230 degrees Celsius. 2 heating element mode.
‚Äì Place the baking tray in the oven, in the middle position of the oven. Bake for 5 minutes, take the baking tray out and immediately spray water on the cake (use a spray bottle), spray both on the surface of the cake and the sides of the cake, until the water condenses into tiny drops on the tray. (Do not spray too little or too much, otherwise the cake will be soggy and the crust will be flaky).
‚Äì After brushing the egg a second time, put the cake in the oven for another 6-8 minutes until the cake turns light golden brown. Take the cake out, let it cool, wrap it tightly with nylon, leave the cake for 2 days until the color of the cake fades, the crust softens because it absorbs the oil, the cake is now very shiny and beautiful.
The cake will turn darker after 2 days. At this point, you can put the cake in a tray and bag, it will look like this ^^
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Experience in choosing moon cake molds
Ingredients:
Wooden mold, plastic mold, spring mold, silicone mold, which mold to choose?
‚Äì The price is much higher than plastic molds. A wooden mold has only one pattern (pattern), if you want many patterns (faces), you have to buy many molds => costs a lot of money.
‚Äì More difficult to preserve and clean. Washing wooden molds is very difficult and takes a lot of time to clean the pattern gaps. If not washed properly, mold can easily form. With hot and humid weather conditions and lots of rain like in Vietnam, most molds will easily form mold.
‚Äì Wooden molds are often heavy and bulky, larger than plastic molds, so they will take up more space in the storage cabinet, making it more inconvenient to carry when needed.
5 or 6 years ago, when I first made mooncakes, and when plastic molds were not yet popular, I bought wooden molds, but in the following years I no longer used wooden molds.
2. Plastic mold
‚Äì The plastic mold has a handle and is exactly like the wooden mold, except the material is plastic. The advantage is that it is much cheaper, lighter, but the cake is not as comfortable to knock as the wooden mold.
‚Äì Cheap plastic molds often have dull patterns and few modern patterns.
3. Spring mold
‚Äì The price is cheaper or equal to wooden molds, the plastic material is hard, the spring is sturdy so the mold still feels very "comfortable" when held in hand.
‚Äì Cleaning the mold is very easy and clean, never worry about mold. The mold is light and compact, very easy to store.
‚Äì Perhaps the best thing is that spring-loaded molds often have many patterned sides for one mold, so you can freely change the appearance of the cake.
‚Äì Using a springform pan, when taking the cake out it is very light and easy, almost no worry of the cake sticking.
‚Äì The spring mold is industrially engraved by machine so the pattern is very sharp.
4. Silicone mold

Title: Vegetarianism and Health (Part 2)
Ingredients:
‚Äì Tribes and mountain people who live mainly on vegetarian diets often have very long life expectancy, such as the Hunza people in India who live to be over 115 years old, a group of 400 people in the mountains of Ecuador who live to be over 100 years old were thoroughly examined and only 2 people showed signs of heart disease, if such an examination were done on Americans it would show that 95% of people have heart disease.
‚Äì Vegetarian children have better teeth, are less likely to get colds and allergies than non-vegetarian children, are less likely to be obese, and have less heart disease.
‚Äì Vegetarians are not weak, pale and sickly as many people mistakenly think, but on the contrary, they are healthier, more agile, and have higher endurance.
‚Äì Many world record-breaking athletes are vegetarians.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Wagashi ‚Äì Japanese confectionery art
Ingredients:
Over the centuries, although wagashi has been heavily influenced by Western cultural elements, wagashi is still regarded as a symbol of Japanese artistic aesthetics.
Wagashi is divided into three main groups, classified based on the moisture content of the cake or the method of making the cake.
The moisture content of the cake is a very important factor in determining the "shelf life" of the cake.
Why is it said that enjoying wagashi can be heard by hearing, that is because the cake can be named after a symbol, a beautiful natural phenomenon of each season, or named after lyrics in poetry, music. When hearing those poetic names, the person enjoying the cake will be able to use his imagination to draw beautiful and poetic natural scenes.
If you come to Japan, don't miss exploring the beautiful world of wagashi.

Title: Converting commonly used materials
Ingredients:
Normally, to make it easier to measure ingredients used in cooking and baking, the kitchen must have a scale and a measuring cup with divisions in cups and ml. The smaller the scale division, the more accurate it is. Of course, if you can afford an electronic scale, it will be much easier to measure. A regular measuring cup like the one above has the largest division up to 2 cups, the quality of the cup and the price also depend on the material and "brand". However, this does not have a big impact on the quality of the cake you want to make, as long as you are careful when measuring the ingredients.
Measuring ingredients in which system of measurement is a flexible thing. When you do a lot of things, you will form a habit of which unit of measurement to use so that you do not have to "get tangled up" with many utensils and dishes, which will waste time washing.

Title: Problems with eggs in baking
Ingredients:
In European and American countries and other developed countries, eggs are classified into clear 'grades', depending on the quality, freshness, and size of the eggs. Eggs will be classified as AA, A or B, C, depending on the convention of each country. In Singapore, eggs also have codes, but most of them are all mixed up, every brand is labeled A or AA, big or small eggs are still A, I can only distinguish based on price, the more expensive the type, I think the higher the quality. In Vietnam, people often buy eggs in supermarkets, or more easily, go to the market to buy eggs, then choosing eggs is based on experience and trust in the seller's advice.
‚Äì Eggs add aroma and flavor to the cake.
‚Äì Like me, every time I buy eggs, I usually buy a tray of 30. When buying in the supermarket, it is difficult to know at the time of purchase how fresh the eggs are. When going to the market in Vietnam, if you buy at a familiar store, the seller will tell you which eggs are new and which are old, and will not recommend that acquaintances buy them.
‚Äì For recipes that require separating the egg whites and yolks, separate carefully to avoid getting the egg whites mixed with the yolks.
+ Egg whites that are wet or have yolks; bowls or beaters that are not dry or clean will also affect the egg beating.

Title: 12 types of nuts for baking
Ingredients:
In this article, I have compiled the names and images of the nuts commonly used in baking, so that beginners who are new to baking will not be confused when entering a store selling baking ingredients, so that they can immediately recognize which type of nut it is. In stores, nuts are often sold as whole nuts, split in half or coarsely chopped. When purchased, they need to be stored in sealed packaging and kept in a dry place, away from light.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Other steps in the bread making process
Ingredients:
1. Kneading time and kneading speed.
Under-kneading or over-kneading both reduce the dough's ability to rise.
Therefore, whether kneading by machine or by hand, visual assessment and hand feel are still the most important. This will be achieved through practice and experience. A well-kneaded dough will feel smooth, elastic and chewy, not sticky.
2. Ferment and let the dough rise
Dough that is fermented at too high a temperature or for too long will become sticky, difficult to work with, and slightly sour.
3. Fold or punch the dough
After the fermentation process is complete, the dough needs to be folded (traditionally called ‚Äúpunching‚Äù the dough) to flatten the risen dough. However, this process is not simply a matter of ‚Äúpunching‚Äù the dough, but rather a series of folding the dough over and over again, with the aim of removing CO2 gas and distributing the yeast and temperature more evenly throughout the dough.
So you can imagine this stage as the movements of stretching the dough out, folding it and pressing it, then stretching the dough out again, folding it and pressing it again.
4. Divide the dough
Depending on the size of the bread you want to make, divide the large dough into smaller dough pieces of equal weight. This should be done quickly to avoid giving the dough too much time and causing it to ferment too much.
5. Round shape
After dividing the dough into equal pieces, each small piece of dough is shaped into a smooth, spherical shape. This is also the shape that allows the dough to rise best during the resting process before baking.
Each round dough will be left to ‚Äúrest‚Äù for 10-20 minutes. The dough is placed on a flat surface, using a tool such as a pot, pan, or box to cover the dough.
7. Shape and transfer to baking tray
8. Proofing (I don't know the equivalent Vietnamese word)
This is the next step in the fermentation process to make the dough rise to the standard volume. The temperature of the proofing process is higher than the fermentation process.
My family usually puts the baking tray in the oven, the oven turns on for about 30 seconds to just above the outside temperature. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size. If the dough doesn't rise enough , the bread will be dense and hard when baked. If the dough rises too much, it will lose its aroma and the texture of the bread will be rough.
9. Baking
a. Oven temperature and baking time.
Baking times vary depending on the type and size of the cake. Here are some basic rules for adjusting oven temperature.
‚Äì Sweet or buttered bread is baked at a lower time to avoid the bread from browning and burning quickly.
b. ‚ÄúWash‚Äù the powder
c. Slit the dough
The slits on the cake help the cake rise better during baking. Usually, there is a special knife for slitting, the slits will be sharper and more precise. My family does not have one, so we often use a razor blade, which makes the slits a bit difficult and therefore limits the cake from rising, making the slits stand out beautifully.
d. Put the cake in the oven
e. Cooling
Once baked, remove from pan/baking pan and cool on rack immediately.
That's all the steps to make a batch of bread. Making bread is actually very elaborate, but in return the aroma of the bread when baked spreads throughout the house, the house smells like the oven, thinking about it is also interesting ^^

Title: Kneading step in bread making process
Ingredients:
In this article I will share the knowledge I have gained about the process of mixing ingredients together.
‚Äì Combine all ingredients to form a uniform dough.
‚Äì Creates conditions for gluten to develop.
‚Äì Knead into a uniform dough.
‚Äì Soften the yeast (same method as above).
‚Äì Add liquid and mix quickly.

Title: This Mid-Autumn Festival... let's make moon cakes :)
Ingredients:
After a while of struggling to knead, roll and bang the wooden mold loudly, the whole family finally got an acceptable tray like this (missed a tiny one because my brother ate it secretly).
After cleaning up a battlefield, I sat down and folded paper boxes to put the cakes in to give as gifts. Although I really wanted to make more, after finishing 3 batches of dough, I was too dizzy, so I had to do this. These are 3 gift boxes for my ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù, as for my boyfriend, I only need quantity, no need for fancy things üòõ
And hope everyone had a meaningful and happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
